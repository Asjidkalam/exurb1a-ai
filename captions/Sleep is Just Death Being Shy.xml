&amp;quot;I... dunno.&amp;quot;</text><text start="9.84" dur="2.68">And he said:
&amp;quot;Well, what do you reckon sleep is for?&amp;quot;</text><text start="12.52" dur="2.06">And I said:
&amp;quot;I... dunno.&amp;quot;</text><text start="14.58" dur="2.38">And he said:
&amp;quot;Sleep&amp;#39;s kinda weird though, huh?&amp;quot;</text><text start="16.96" dur="1.56">And I said:
&amp;quot;...Eeeh...&amp;quot;</text><text start="18.52" dur="3.46">And he said:
&amp;quot;Sleep is a lot like dying, really, isn&amp;#39;t it?&amp;quot;</text><text start="21.98" dur="0.96">And I said:</text><text start="22.94" dur="2.04">&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m six FUCKING YEARS OLD!&amp;quot;</text><text start="26.26" dur="1.9">The Greek god of sleep is called Hypnos.</text><text start="28.16" dur="3.52">He has a brother called Thanatos, and he&amp;#39;s the god of death.</text><text start="31.68" dur="2.22">This is gonna be a jolly 10 minutes!</text><text start="33.9" dur="1.54">Sleep makes no sense.</text><text start="35.44" dur="2.26">It leaves us completely defenseless for hours on end,</text><text start="37.7" dur="2.5">and it probably isn&amp;#39;t even for saving energy, either.</text><text start="40.2" dur="3.46">Compared to just lying around awake, sleep will save you about a hundred calories,</text><text start="43.66" dur="3.32">or a banana of slightly above average... girth.</text><text start="46.98" dur="4.14">Humans need about eight hours sleep a night, but our animal friends vary wildly.</text><text start="51.12" dur="1.9">Koalas prefer 22 hours,</text><text start="53.02" dur="1.22">bunnies about nine,</text><text start="54.24" dur="1.48">elephants need just four,</text><text start="55.72" dur="1.66">and however badly your day is going,</text><text start="57.38" dur="4.46">I would like to invite you to just enjoy this picture of an elephant calf taking a nap for a moment.</text><text start="61.84" dur="1.92">There. That&amp;#39;s better, isn&amp;#39;t it?</text><text start="64.26" dur="1.4">No, me neither.</text><text start="65.66" dur="5.96">But whatever sleep is for, it&amp;#39;s so essential that nature wired it into almost every half-intelligent organism on the planet.</text><text start="71.62" dur="1.44">For example, dolphins.</text><text start="73.06" dur="3.98">If they slept like us, they would drown, because they don&amp;#39;t have gills, and they need oxygen.</text><text start="77.04" dur="3.72">So they sleep unihemispherically – that is, they float just below the water,</text><text start="80.76" dur="3.74">and one side of their brain sleeps while the other stays awake, then they swap over.</text><text start="84.5" dur="1.22">Human death rehearsal –</text><text start="85.72" dur="1.88">heh, excuse me, I mean, sleep –</text><text start="87.6" dur="1.42">is a bit more straightforward:</text><text start="89.02" dur="3.96">teeth, toilet, spot of hysterical crying – and it&amp;#39;s off to the Land of Nod.</text><text start="92.98" dur="2.02">Stage 1: brainwaves slow down a bit.</text><text start="95" dur="3.86">Stage 2: your pulse will slow down, and you&amp;#39;ll begin producing sleep spindles,</text><text start="98.86" dur="1.86">which are little bursts of brainwaves that...</text><text start="100.72" dur="2.38">Well, we don&amp;#39;t know what they do exactly, but</text><text start="103.1" dur="1.76">they look a bit- they look a bit like that...</text><text start="104.86" dur="0.74">So...</text><text start="105.6" dur="0.58">heh...</text><text start="106.18" dur="0.74">Yeah...</text><text start="106.92" dur="2.74">Stages 3 and 4 are the deepest levels of sleep.</text><text start="109.66" dur="2.36">Growth hormone is released, tissue is being repaired,</text><text start="112.02" dur="1.4">then stage 5:</text><text start="113.42" dur="2.22">Rapid Eye Movement, or REM stage.</text><text start="115.64" dur="2.44">Your brain kindly paralyzes your body, mostly;</text><text start="118.08" dur="2.02">the eyes roll about, the face twitches,</text><text start="120.1" dur="1.22">brainwaves go mental,</text><text start="121.32" dur="2.4">and this is where about 80% of dreams occur.</text><text start="123.72" dur="3.58">Anyway, the funny part about all this, of course, is when we&amp;#39;re not dreaming while asleep –</text><text start="127.3" dur="1.52">where do we go?</text><text start="128.82" dur="3.7">It&amp;#39;s just black, it&amp;#39;s just oblivion – every night, over and over.</text><text start="132.52" dur="2.56">Because sleep is just death being shy.</text><text start="135.08" dur="4.4">If we got news that an asteroid was approaching, scheduled for arrival, say, 60 years from now,</text><text start="139.48" dur="2.94">and it was so gigantic it would wipe out our entire civilization,</text><text start="142.42" dur="2.04">we would probably go fucking nuclear.</text><text start="144.46" dur="3.64">Riots, war – maybe end the world before the asteroid even arrived.</text><text start="148.1" dur="3.18">And yet, there IS an asteroid, approaching slowly in the distance,</text><text start="151.28" dur="1.88">but it only gets one of us at a time,</text><text start="153.16" dur="1.6">and we practice for it every night.</text><text start="154.76" dur="1.96">And its name... is Death.</text><text start="156.72" dur="3.24">With an asteroid, the whole species will be gone in a few days, probably.</text><text start="159.96" dur="1.92">With death as it stands today, though,</text><text start="161.88" dur="2.8">maybe we take comfort in the fact that even though we&amp;#39;ll be gone,</text><text start="164.68" dur="2.24">the world will still carry on without us.</text><text start="167.3" dur="4.68">But ignoring technology and politics, we do know a bit about the future we&amp;#39;ll all miss out on.</text><text start="171.98" dur="3.12">And if it cheers you up, we can take a little tour of that future.</text><text start="175.1" dur="3.84">Just for fun, let&amp;#39;s say sometime in the next few years you become a parent to two children,</text><text start="178.94" dur="3.44">and that the average human generation cycle is about 30 years.</text><text start="182.38" dur="3.36">Well, by the 2080s we&amp;#39;re two generations down the line.</text><text start="185.74" dur="3.5">You are now a grandparent, and six humans have inherited your DNA.</text><text start="189.24" dur="3.24">If humans have made it to Mars, on November 10th, 2084,</text><text start="192.48" dur="3.12">the colonists will witness the transit of Earth from Mars –</text><text start="195.6" dur="3.24">the Earth resembling a black disc, passing across the Sun.</text><text start="198.84" dur="2.24">2110, another generation later,</text><text start="201.08" dur="2.16">and assuming humans have, on average, two children,</text><text start="203.24" dur="3.22">your children have grandchildren now, and you have 14 descendants.</text><text start="206.46" dur="2.18">It&amp;#39;s quite possible they attended your funeral.</text><text start="208.64" dur="3.84">Don&amp;#39;t worry, everyone got smashed in the pub afterwards, and said nice things about your hair.</text><text start="212.48" dur="5.28">The world population is probably around 11 billion humans, having jumped 4 billion in just a century.</text><text start="217.76" dur="2.1">The 2140s, another generation.</text><text start="219.86" dur="3.3">All things being equal, 30 humans now carry your genes.</text><text start="223.16" dur="3.62">2200 – another generation – and we&amp;#39;re into the 23rd century.</text><text start="226.78" dur="2.06">Halley&amp;#39;s Comet has just reached its perihelion;</text><text start="228.84" dur="1.96">you have 62 descendants.</text><text start="230.8" dur="2.44">The mid-2200s, now six generations –</text><text start="233.24" dur="2.12">that&amp;#39;s 126 descendants of yours.</text><text start="235.36" dur="3.4">Leeloo and Korben Dallas will shortly be initiating a romantic relationship,</text><text start="238.76" dur="2.82">and by the end of this century, still at two children per generation,</text><text start="241.58" dur="2.46">you now have 2050 descendants.</text><text start="244.04" dur="3.46">We can no longer even speculate what culture and technology looks like, so...</text><text start="247.5" dur="3.7">Year 12,000 AD, 240 generations later.</text><text start="251.2" dur="3.76">If sex is even still in fashion, you now have at least several million descendants.</text><text start="254.96" dur="2.52">The star Antares has just gone supernova, probably,</text><text start="257.48" dur="2.4">and will be visible from the Earth even in daylight.</text><text start="259.88" dur="4.36">Year 52,000 AD, 1,500 generations of your progeny later,</text><text start="264.24" dur="2.7">and the Earth&amp;#39;s rotation will have slowed enough, courtesy of the Moon,</text><text start="266.94" dur="2.66">that we&amp;#39;ll need to add a leap second to preserve timekeeping.</text><text start="269.6" dur="3.34">Year 100,000 AD, 3,000 generations later.</text><text start="272.94" dur="2.98">You might recognize the constellations, but they&amp;#39;ll be altered –</text><text start="275.92" dur="3.46">the handle of the Big Dipper getting a little relaxed at the back, for example.</text><text start="279.38" dur="4.24">250,000 AD, 7,500 generations later.</text><text start="283.62" dur="6.22">Loihi, currently a submarine volcano in 2019, will have risen out of the ocean and become a volcanic island.</text><text start="289.84" dur="1.44">2 million AD.</text><text start="291.28" dur="2.78">The Grand Canyon erodes to surround the Colorado River,</text><text start="294.06" dur="2.74">if there is, indeed, still a Colorado River left.</text><text start="296.8" dur="1.42">50 million AD.</text><text start="298.22" dur="3.62">Eurasia and Africa collide, forming an entirely new mountain range.</text><text start="301.84" dur="2.12">500 to 600 million AD.</text><text start="303.96" dur="3.48">It&amp;#39;s possible Earth&amp;#39;s continents have fused back into a single supercontinent.</text><text start="307.44" dur="2.36">A day on Earth has probably gained at least an hour.</text><text start="309.8" dur="3.6">Our moon is now so distant, solar eclipses never happen again.</text><text start="313.4" dur="1.46">One billion AD.</text><text start="314.86" dur="4.02">The Sun is now ten percent more luminous, meaning our oceans have begun to evaporate.</text><text start="318.88" dur="2.04">Plant life is... unlikely.</text><text start="320.92" dur="1.52">Four billion AD.</text><text start="322.44" dur="5.42">The Milky Way, our galaxy, and our neighboring galaxy Andromeda collide, forming Milkomeda.</text><text start="327.86" dur="1.26">Ten billion AD.</text><text start="329.12" dur="6.1">The Sun is now 256 times its current size, and has almost certainly swallowed Mercury, Venus, and Earth.</text><text start="335.22" dur="1.48">One trillion AD.</text><text start="336.7" dur="4.72">It&amp;#39;s possible the Big Crunch has now begun, the remains of the universe falling back in on herself.</text><text start="341.42" dur="3.16">Galactic clusters will begin to converge, stars will collide,</text><text start="344.58" dur="3.52">the resulting explosions illuminating the heavens nearby and distant.</text><text start="348.1" dur="3.08">Eventually, the black holes of the universe will collide with one another,</text><text start="351.18" dur="4.68">amassing into a single super-supermassive black hole consuming itself.</text><text start="355.86" dur="1.9">One quadrillion AD.</text><text start="357.76" dur="5.18">It&amp;#39;s also possible no Big Crunch will occur, and the universe will continue to expand indefinitely.</text><text start="362.94" dur="5.24">In this scenario the main points of interest for the next almost infinite period of time will be the decay of nucleons –</text><text start="368.18" dur="1.46">that&amp;#39;s protons and neutrons –</text><text start="369.64" dur="2.92">beginning an era in which only black holes exist in the universe,</text><text start="372.56" dur="2.42">and, assuming a new universe has not begun,</text><text start="374.98" dur="2.8">the current universe will achieve its final resting energy:</text><text start="377.78" dur="2.74">uninhabited, uninhabitable, barren –</text><text start="380.52" dur="1.86">perpetual, limitless dark,</text><text start="382.38" dur="5.2">with no recourse to the fecundity that once teemed within the boundaries of creation.</text><text start="388.78" dur="3.4">We all must have gone through that phase as a kid, when it hit us:</text><text start="392.18" dur="1.46">&amp;quot;Well, people die eventually,</text><text start="393.64" dur="1.26">and mom and dad are people,</text><text start="394.9" dur="1.38">and I&amp;#39;m a person, so...</text><text start="396.28" dur="1.3">OH GOD!&amp;quot;</text><text start="397.58" dur="4.08">Some of us, including your pompous narrator here, never recovered from that phase.</text><text start="401.66" dur="5.2">It is simply too much: to live as the only animal that knows its projects and loves and lifetimes are limited,</text><text start="406.86" dur="4.62">and when the animal is gone, after a while it&amp;#39;ll be as though the animal never was at all.</text><text start="411.48" dur="3.92">And that is a notion too wide and spiky to fit inside the head.</text><text start="415.4" dur="2.02">The things we will miss after we&amp;#39;re gone:</text><text start="417.42" dur="2.62">the parties, the births of humans we would come to love,</text><text start="420.04" dur="1.6">all the walks, all the hugs,</text><text start="421.64" dur="3.24">all the plucky steps into the dark our species will take yet.</text><text start="424.88" dur="1.04">Homo sapiens?</text><text start="425.92" dur="2.2">Yeah, right – homo nihilus, more like.</text><text start="428.12" dur="2.58">The only animal conscious of its approaching demise,</text><text start="430.7" dur="2.48">and conscious of the world&amp;#39;s approaching demise, too.</text><text start="433.18" dur="3">I suspect you, like me, have run into these people in life,</text><text start="436.18" dur="2.22">who are terribly clever, and yet terribly broken.</text><text start="438.4" dur="3.56">Because they&amp;#39;ve looked into the abyss and concluded that on a long enough time scale,</text><text start="441.96" dur="4.22">and in a universe so wide and apparently indifferent, we have no ultimate significance,</text><text start="446.18" dur="2.38">and the point has dropped out of everything for them.</text><text start="448.56" dur="5.08">But there IS a middle way between denial – &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m so fucking important, look at my bank balance&amp;quot;, etc. –</text><text start="453.64" dur="4.28">and despair – &amp;quot;there&amp;#39;s no point to anything if we all just go off into the dark&amp;quot;, etc.</text><text start="457.92" dur="3">Because the world is just this fantastical as it is horrific,</text><text start="460.92" dur="3.14">and it&amp;#39;s just as arbitrary to lose hope as it is to find it.</text><text start="464.06" dur="3">If everything was forever, would that really change so much?</text><text start="467.06" dur="4.68">80 years or a trillion – beer would still taste just as good, wasps would still be pricks –</text><text start="471.74" dur="1.08">Fuck you, wasps!</text><text start="472.82" dur="4.16">– and maybe tomorrow we&amp;#39;ll kill aging, and death, and stay up infinitely past bedtime.</text><text start="476.98" dur="2.58">But as it stands today, we don&amp;#39;t have the science yet.</text><text start="479.56" dur="3.52">And so, god-fearing or not, we have to find some way of making peace with the thing.</text><text start="483.08" dur="4.24">For you it might be religion, or some variant of spirituality – and, fair enough.</text><text start="487.32" dur="2.2">But I&amp;#39;ll tell you what works for me personally, though.</text><text start="489.52" dur="4.76">When it&amp;#39;s late, and I can&amp;#39;t sleep, and the abyss starts whispering about how I&amp;#39;m gonna go into the dark one day,</text><text start="494.28" dur="3.56">I keep in mind that whether I like it or not, I am part of something bigger –</text><text start="497.84" dur="2.28">an experiment conducted across the entire planet,</text><text start="500.12" dur="1.72">conducted across all of history –</text><text start="501.84" dur="1.16">called &amp;quot;us&amp;quot;.</text><text start="503.48" dur="4.12">Somewhere in the future, we are gone, and someone who loves us is remembering us.</text><text start="507.6" dur="3.62">Somewhere ahead of that, they are gone, and someone who loves them is remembering them.</text><text start="511.22" dur="2.3">The interminable rise and fall of generations.</text><text start="513.52" dur="3.42">How many of us have been and gone down here since we became Homo sapiens?</text><text start="516.94" dur="1.64">Billions, at the very least.</text><text start="518.58" dur="1.62">To have stubbed one&amp;#39;s toe,</text><text start="520.2" dur="1.74">to have heard a new word and looked it up,</text><text start="521.94" dur="3.3">to have yelled at the GPS as though it&amp;#39;s the GPS&amp;#39;s fault you got lost,</text><text start="525.24" dur="6.02">to have watched another human blowing their nose or picking their teeth, or something equally disgusting, and quietly thought to oneself,</text><text start="531.26" dur="2.74">&amp;quot;Oh, fuck – I&amp;#39;ve fallen in love with you, haven&amp;#39;t I...&amp;quot;</text><text start="534" dur="3.08">Just to have BEEN anything – what a weird honor!</text><text start="537.08" dur="4.26">If sleep is just death being shy, then waking up is atoms being miraculous.</text><text start="541.34" dur="3.98">The fact that for about 80 years atoms know they&amp;#39;re even atoms at all,</text><text start="545.32" dur="1.76">courtesy of being humans.</text><text start="547.08" dur="2.26">Birth, death, the silly bit in between –</text><text start="549.34" dur="2.2">if none of it has any ultimate significance,</text><text start="551.54" dur="2.46">if, on a cosmic scale, none of it matters...</text><text start="554" dur="1.72">does that really fucking matter?</text><text start="555.72" dur="2.38">We won&amp;#39;t last forever, but while we&amp;#39;re here,</text><text start="558.1" dur="3.46">What a silly decision it would be to waste our day out in the cosmos –</text><text start="561.56" dur="2.6">that brief period of time when matter woke up,</text><text start="564.16" dur="1.98">on a world as interesting as this one,</text><text start="566.14" dur="1.76">with hair as
