Five out of ten.</text><text start="8.02" dur="3.58">2) No universe, just me. This is called solipsism and shut up.</text><text start="11.6" dur="0.9">One out of ten.</text><text start="12.5" dur="2.48">3) Zoo for humans made by Shiva.</text><text start="15.18" dur="3.58">This is number one in disguise, but she is considerably more attractive than Yahweh</text><text start="18.76" dur="2.5">and has bazongas, so: six out of ten.</text><text start="21.26" dur="2.7">4) It just is. Stop assuming stuff has meaning.</text><text start="23.96" dur="2.06">More rational approach. Eight out of ten.</text><text start="26.04" dur="2.64">5) One out of ten. Lack of imagination.</text><text start="28.68" dur="2.12">Yes, but what does universe really do?</text><text start="30.81" dur="4.14">Well, the universe expands very fast, 13 billion years ago, and slowly loses heat,</text><text start="34.95" dur="3.85">eventually spreads out until there aren&amp;#39;t any stars or nebulas left, and we&amp;#39;re watching it wind down.</text><text start="38.8" dur="2.12">The universe is a big wind down machine.</text><text start="40.92" dur="2.68">Nine out of ten. Excellent, based on empirical evidence.</text><text start="43.6" dur="2.38">Or, the universe is a complexity machine.</text><text start="45.989" dur="3.181">Atoms build into molecules, which build into planets, and then DNA and organisms,</text><text start="49.17" dur="2.37">and swans, and sea cows, and yes,</text><text start="51.54" dur="2.68">very clever carbon units that make stuff with their opposable thumbs,</text><text start="54.22" dur="3.24">walk around on two legs and maybe, just maybe, they make more complex stuff than them,</text><text start="57.46" dur="1.9">like computers that are conscious, and...</text><text start="59.36" dur="2.86">don&amp;#39;t die of pneumonia, or cancer, or E. coli, or anything silly, and...</text><text start="62.22" dur="3.68">those machines make stuff that are more complex than they are, and so on, and so on, and so on, and...</text><text start="65.9" dur="2.7">The universe isn&amp;#39;t running down, that&amp;#39;s just a byproduct.</text><text start="68.6" dur="1.18">The Universe is speeding up.</text><text start="69.78" dur="3.26">It took billions of years to make an Earth, and only took a few million to make a human,</text><text start="73.04" dur="3.14">and then only 20,000 to make a human that didn&amp;#39;t have to hunt all the time,</text><text start="76.18" dur="3.88">and then only a few thousand years for radio, and then fifty for television, and thirty for the internet.</text><text start="80.06" dur="4.74">Yes, we&amp;#39;re small, and space is very, very big -- but ultimately it doesn&amp;#39;t matter which telescope you look up.</text><text start="84.8" dur="3.14">The most complex thing we&amp;#39;ve ever seen the universe make is looking up that telescope.</text><text start="87.94" dur="2.58">The universe isn&amp;#39;t wearing out or dying -- it&amp;#39;s waking up.</text><text start="90.52" dur="2.94">It&amp;#39;s evolving more and more complex patterns and more and more complex shapes,</text><text start="93.46" dur="3.34">and you are the most complex thing it&amp;#39;s ever done that we know of.</text><text start="96.8" dur="4.36">So next time you&amp;#39;re feeling glum, keep in mind your brain is the fucking icing on the universe cake, yeah?</text><text start="101.16" dur="2.18">And it took 13 billion years to make that cake, yeah?</text><text start="103.34" dur="1.3">And it was very hard to pull off,</text><text start="104.64" dur="2.84">and there were a number of complicated instructions to follow -- but here you are,</text><text start="107.48" dur="3.3">for about 80 years or so, living in the most exciting time in human history that&amp;#39;s ever happened,</text><text start="110.78" dur="1.78">so just shut up!
