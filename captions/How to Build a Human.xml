Okay?</text><text start="15.82" dur="1.7">Don&amp;#39;t worry.

million sperm, one gets through and fertilizes an egg of your mother&amp;#39;s, creating a zygote.</text><text start="26.36" dur="1.04">And congratulations!</text><text start="27.4" dur="2.48">That was probably the most remarkable thing you will ever do.</text><text start="29.88" dur="1.5">Within about a day, the egg</text><text start="31.38" dur="0.82">or blastocyst</text><text start="32.2"

endometrium.</text><text start="37.56" dur="2.82">Give it about three weeks and the little sucker already has nerve cells.</text><text start="40.38" dur="1.96">By about month two, you have little grabby bits,</text><text start="42.34" dur="0.76">walky bits,</text><text start="43.1" dur="3.62">and you already sort of resemble a human at about an inch long and a thirtieth of an ounce.</text><text start="46.72" dur="0.72">Good job.</text><text start="47.44" dur="1.84">By about month five, your muscles are fairly developed</text><text start="49.28" dur="3.58">and you might start jiggling about in a medical process known as womb raving.</text><text start="52.86" dur="3.1">By month seven, your hearing is working and you&amp;#39;re about 14 inches long.</text><text

30 trillion cells which come in about 200 flavors.</text><text start="82.82" dur="1.14">For example:</text><text start="84.3" dur="0.72">White Blood Cells</text><text start="85.02"

included because when I discovered the word about a week ago,</text><text start="100.78" dur="1.82">I almost dirtied my undergarments.</text><text start="102.6" dur="1.64">Spermatozoon.</text><text start="104.24" dur="2.92">Sometimes cells collect into organs directed by DNA.</text><text start="107.16" dur="1.16">Organs form systems.</text><text start="108.32" dur="2.36">There are about 10 systems going on all at once in your body.</text><text start="110.68" dur="1.04">Nasty stuff first,</text><text start="111.72" dur="1.079">there&amp;#39;s the renal system,</text><text start="112.8" dur="3.44">which is made up of the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra.</text><text start="124" dur="4.6">Except me because I have no obvious function in the body getting infected and killing you.</text><text start="130.66" dur="4.08">The kidneys filter blood of nasties which can then be expelled from your body and left on the toilet seat</text><text start="134.74" dur="1.76">for the next poor person at the bar to come in</text><text start="136.5" dur="2.4">and find and get blamed for if he doesn&amp;#39;t clean it up.</text><text start="139.62" dur="0.72">Prick.</text><text start="140.34" dur="4.72">There&amp;#39;s the cardiovascular/circulatory system which gets blood from A to B and back again.</text><text start="145.06" dur="1.24">What is blood exactly?</text><text start="146.3" dur="1.24">Well I&amp;#39;m glad you asked.</text><text start="147.54" dur="1.38">Red and complicated.</text><text start="148.92" dur="2.5">It isn&amp;#39;t ever blue when it&amp;#39;s in your veins by the way.</text><text start="151.42" dur="0.74">That&amp;#39;s bollocks.</text><text start="152.16" dur="2.47">One regular passenger on the blood underground is oxygen.</text><text start="154.63" dur="5.23">The lungs absorb oxygen down through the bronchioles into about 300 million alveoli and then into the blood.</text><text start="159.86" dur="3.26">Your heart keeps the blood flowing about 1,800 gallons of the stuff every day</text><text start="163.12" dur="3.66">and supply cells with oxygen which is basically how they release energy and do their thing.</text><text start="166.78" dur="2.36">However, your cells also need foods.</text><text start="169.14" dur="3.78">Digestion begins in the mouth with saliva, which is full of an enzyme called amylase.</text><text start="172.92" dur="3.14">It then takes a little trip in the stomach where it&amp;#39;s dissolved by more enzymes,</text><text start="176.06" dur="1.12">namely pepsin.</text><text start="182.3" dur="3.1">The first recorded removal of an appendix was in 1735 by the name of</text><text start="187.42" dur="2.88">Enzymes are the cocaine of digestion, they speed things up.</text><text start="190.3" dur="3.12">Then food is attacked by acids which break it down mostly into glucose.</text><text start="193.48" dur="4.28">It moves into the intestines which you have about 25 feet, or 7 meters of and passes into the blood.</text><text start="197.76" dur="2.38">Your pancreas releases insulin accordingly</text><text start="200.14" dur="3.82">which tells your cells to stop mucking about and actually absorb the glucose, and you know, like,</text><text start="203.96" dur="0.8">keep you alive</text><text start="204.76" dur="0.64">and shit</text><text start="205.4" dur="0.62">Please?</text><text start="206.02" dur="2.5">Which it does and if you&amp;#39;re watching this, then congratulations.</text><text start="208.52" dur="0.68">You in fact,</text><text start="209.2" dur="0.94">still alive.</text><text start="210.14" dur="1.68">And that&amp;#39;s also thanks to vitamins.</text><text start="211.82" dur="3.6">Vitamins are essential for humaning, but your body is crap at producing them.</text><text start="215.42" dur="1.6">Take vitamin C for example.</text><text start="217.02" dur="2.08">For some reason humans can&amp;#39;t produce it themselves.</text><text start="219.1" dur="2.3">And when you don&amp;#39;t get enough, you get other stuff instead.</text><text start="221.4" dur="0.82">Like scurvy</text><text start="222.22" dur="0.7">or dead</text><text start="222.92" dur="1.18">or most likely both.</text><text start="224.3" dur="1.82">Vitamin B1 is also weird.</text><text start="226.12" dur="2.52">You only need roughly an ounce spread across your lifetime,</text><text start="228.64" dur="2.5">which is about 28 grams or as I like to call it</text><text start="231.14" dur="0.86">a fun evening in.</text><text start="232" dur="2.25">28 grams is nothing over 80 years.</text><text start="234.25" dur="0.9">But if you don&amp;#39;t get it</text><text start="235.15" dur="2.27">you&amp;#39;ll be rewarded with a number of achievements including</text><text start="237.42" dur="0.98">chronic fatigue,</text><text start="238.4" dur="1.08">heart complications,</text><text start="239.48" dur="0.9">and psychosis.</text><text start="240.82" dur="0.62">Lovely!</text><text start="241.44" dur="1.22">Then there is the endocrine system</text><text start="242.66" dur="1.8">Not to be confused with the exocrine</text><text start="244.46" dur="1.1">or Endor system.</text><text start="245.56" dur="3.36">This produces hormones. Hormones tell your body to do pretty much everything</text><text start="248.92" dur="1.26">from sleep to sexy times</text><text start="250.18" dur="2.68">and imbalances can make you a seriously sad panda.</text><text start="252.86" dur="3.8">Then there&amp;#39;s the integumentary system which is basically skin and protected tissue.</text><text start="256.66" dur="1.52">Skin is an organ too by the way.</text><text start="258.18" dur="2.86">The muscular/skeletal system, fairly self-explanatory.</text><text start="261.04" dur="1.1">Well, not really.</text><text start="262.14" dur="2.94">There just aren&amp;#39;t that many orthopedic jokes to be quite honest with you.</text><text start="265.08" dur="1.06">There&amp;#39;s the reproductive system</text><text start="266.14" dur="2.46">which is in between your legs and for making the babies.</text><text start="268.6" dur="1.84">And oh, what&amp;#39;s that?</text><text start="270.44" dur="3.62">It&amp;#39;s a sternly worded email from YouTube insisting if I talk about dicks again,</text><text start="274.06" dur="1.94">I won&amp;#39;t have a channel.
