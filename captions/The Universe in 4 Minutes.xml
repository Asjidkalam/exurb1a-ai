We will start with Tyrion Lannister of physics -</text><text start="3.72" dur="0.78">The Planck Length</text><text start="4.5" dur="2.06">Which is the smallest thing you can sensibly talk about.</text><text start="6.56" dur="0.94">Probably...</text><text start="7.5" dur="2.5">Next stop - we will lose our subatomic partical virginity</text><text start="10" dur="1.2">and meet our first neutrino.</text><text start="11.2" dur="1">Dont worry, she&amp;#39;s lovely</text><text start="12.2" dur="1.5">and she has a lots of friends.</text><text start="13.7" dur="3.5">There are around 65 billion of them passing through just 1 square cm of Earth every second.</text><text start="17.7" dur="3.3">Up next - we bump into quarks. These come in several flavours:</text><text start="21" dur="3.4">Up, Down, Strange, Charm, Top, Bottom and
Banana</text><text start="24.4" dur="3.4">These are about as close to the building blocks of nature as we have managed to get so far.</text><text start="27.8" dur="3.2">Next stop -  we get to the A-list celebritites of subatomic world</text><text start="31" dur="2">Derek Neutron and Barbara Proton</text><text start="33" dur="1.5">Usually they engage in three ways:</text><text start="34.5" dur="2.9">With Carmen Electron and a kinky arrangement  known as atoms</text><text start="37.4" dur="1.9">Funny thing about subatomical particles:</text><text start="39.4" dur="2.1">Sometimes they behave as waves,
other times as particles</text><text start="41.5" dur="2.7">Depending on how they are feeling and whether or not are they on their period</text><text start="44.2" dur="2.3">Which brings us to some more celebrities you have heard of</text><text start="46.5" dur="2.8">Such as Helium, Hydrogen, Carbon and Cesium</text><text start="49.3" dur="2.5">All of this stuff so far and everything in the universe</text><text start="51.8" dur="1.4">Is controlled by 4 forces:</text><text start="53.2" dur="3.5">The Strong Force, which generally binds quarks, protons and neutrons together.</text><text start="56.7" dur="2.5">Then there&amp;#39;s weak force, which regulates radioactive decay.</text><text start="59.2" dur="2.8">The electromagnetic force, which holds atoms and molecules together</text><text start="62" dur="0.5">Basically...</text><text start="62.6" dur="4">And finally - gravity. He was the promiscuous hussie of physics and regulates everything else</text><text start="66.6" dur="2">Like universes.
But we&amp;#39;ll get to there later</text><text start="68.6" dur="2.1">All the stuff is contained in a neat little package</text><text start="70.7" dur="3.6">called The Standard Model and is about as close to a theory of everything we&amp;#39;ve managed to get so far.</text><text start="74.3" dur="3">Generally, the little stuff comes under a title Quantum Physics</text><text start="77.3" dur="2.9">And a big stuff, to which we get to in a moment, is known as Relativistic Physics</text><text start="80.2" dur="2.8">Scientists are working very hard on getting the two of them to move in together</text><text start="83" dur="2">But currently they have severe commitment issues</text><text start="85" dur="2">A little further up we get to the code of life</text><text start="87" dur="2.1">Deoxyribonucleic acid, also known as</text><text start="89.1" dur="0.9">DNA (AAA!)</text><text start="90" dur="2">DNA is made of a sneeze called</text><text start="92" dur="0.7">ATCG</text><text start="92.7" dur="2.8">Or Adenine,  Thymine, Cytosine, Guanine</text><text start="95.5" dur="1.5">Depending on how these are arranged</text><text start="97" dur="4.2">You can get anything from Ebola virus to Papyrus, to the German Iris to Miley Cyrus</text><text start="101.2" dur="1.5">Up some more, we get the cells</text><text start="102.7" dur="1.3">Some top favourites including</text><text start="104" dur="2.6">Red Blood, White Blood, Dendritic and soft</text><text start="106.6" dur="1.6">The next level above that should be familiar</text><text start="108.5" dur="4.2">This is where we find raindrops, Blue Whales, hakisaks, Redtube, the human race</text><text start="112.7" dur="1.3">as well as Norway</text><text start="114" dur="1">Out a little further</text><text start="115" dur="1.8">Now we are looking down on all of human history</text><text start="116.8" dur="3.8">Including all of our insecurities, morgage repayments and ex-sexual partners</text><text start="120.6" dur="2">Which reminds me Natasha</text><text start="123.4" dur="0.7">You&amp;#39;re a b*tch!</text><text start="124.1" dur="3.2">Moving on we get to the eight planets and 146 moons of our Solar system</text><text start="127.3" dur="0.9">which doesn&amp;#39;t count Pluto</text><text start="128.2" dur="1.8">Because you are not a planet, Pluto</text><text start="130" dur="1.9">You are done mate!
It&amp;#39;s over! Yeah.</text><text start="132.2" dur="3.4">Then there&amp;#39;s the Sun, which is a four and a half billion year old burning ball of Hydrogen and Helium</text><text start="135.6" dur="1.3">Several billion years from now</text><text start="136.9" dur="2">The Sun will rage quit and turn into a red giant</text><text start="138.9" dur="2">Gobbling whatever is left of a planet by then</text><text start="140.9" dur="2.9">Out again, we find the Milky Way.
The Milky Way contains at least a</text><text start="143.8" dur="1">100 billion stars</text><text start="144.8" dur="2.2">Stars can be by themselves, or orbiting each other</text><text start="147" dur="1.6">called a Binary Star System</text><text start="148.6" dur="3.3">Or occasional group of three, which is called a Trinary/Ternary</text><text start="151.9" dur="1.2">Or MÃ©nage a Star</text><text start="153.1" dur="0.9">And that&amp;#39;s not all</text><text start="154" dur="3">There&amp;#39;s also Nebulae, which is a little starry womb where a lots of stars are born</text><text start="157" dur="2.2">Moons, which either come from planets or are a random floating matter</text><text start="159.2" dur="3.4">And comets, meteors and a million other types of astronomical bodies</text><text start="162.6" dur="1.4">that there simply isn&amp;#39;t time to talk about</text><text start="164" dur="1">At the center of our galaxy</text><text start="165" dur="1.6">And lots of other galaxies, are black holes</text><text start="166.6" dur="2.4">These are enourmous wells of gravity that suck matter in</text><text start="169" dur="1">And distort thyme (time)</text><text start="170" dur="3.2">Fun fact: If you&amp;#39;d hold your breath while falling into a black hole</text><text start="173.2" dur="1.6">You would die, obviously</text><text start="174.8" dur="1.9">And then there&amp;#39;s the rest of the Universe</text><text start="176.7" dur="2.8">The Milky Way, our galaxy, is one of a list of hundred billion galaxies</text><text start="179.5" dur="1.4">Each one prettier than the last</text><text start="180.9" dur="3.5">Since there are a 100 billion galaxies with at least a 100 billion stars in them</text><text start="184.4" dur="3.4">That means there are at least
10 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 (do the math) stars</text><text start="187.8" dur="1.2">In the Universe</text><text start="189" dur="3.6">The Universe itself, as far as we are aware, is about 95 billion lightyears across</text><text start="192.6" dur="2">Or to put it in another way.
If you are travelling with the speed of light</text><text start="194.6" dur="2">300 000 kilometers per second</text><text start="196.6" dur="2.5">It would take you 95 000 000 000 years to get from one side to the other</text><text start="199.1" dur="2.6">Except for the fact that the Universe is expanding</text><text start="201.7" dur="1.7">And the expansion is getting faster</text><text start="203.4" dur="1.7">Which literally makes no sense</text><text start="205.2" dur="2">And a... yeah.
That&amp;#39;s... that&amp;#39;s about it really.</text><text start="207.2" dur="1.5">Oh! Except there might be</text><text start="208.7" dur="1.5">Parallel universes</text><text start="210.2" dur="2.3">And hidden dimensions of space</text><text start="214" dur="1.4">And we completely forgot about time</text><text start="215.4" dur="2.6">The Universe began, if you can call it that, about 14 billion years ago</text><text start="218" dur="2.4">The first few galaxies turned up a few hundred million years later.</text><text start="220.4" dur="2">A few hundred millions after that we get the Milky Way</text><text start="222.4" dur="1.6">Another few and you&amp;#39;ve got a very young Earth</text><text start="224" dur="0.7">Then oceans</text><text start="224.7" dur="0.9">Then life a bit later</text><text start="225.6" dur="0.6">Reptiles</text><text start="226.2" dur="0.8">Dinosaurs</text><text start="227" dur="1.3">Game over for dinosaurs.
Sorry chaps.</text><text start="228.3" dur="1.3">Evolution of hominids</text><text start="229.6" dur="1.4">And finally all of our bullsh*t</text><text start="231" dur="0.8">Here...</text><text start="231.8" dur="1.2">Or here
