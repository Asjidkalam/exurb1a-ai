My God. How did it happen?&amp;quot;</text><text start="15.5" dur="4.14">&amp;quot;ah... Embarrassingly? Don&amp;#39;t worry about it. You want some Kombucha tea?&amp;quot;</text><text start="19.64" dur="0.84">&amp;quot;What?&amp;quot;</text><text start="20.64" dur="2.1">&amp;quot;No, it&amp;#39;s fine. Everything&amp;#39;s fine. You&amp;#39;re safe here.&amp;quot;</text><text start="22.9" dur="4.52">&amp;quot;What about my family and my wife? She&amp;#39;ll be lonely! What would she do?&amp;quot;</text><text start="27.42" dur="3.6">&amp;quot;Yeah... Let&amp;#39;s just say Tom across the road took care of that.&amp;quot;</text><text start="31.02" dur="1.77">&amp;quot;Tom Evans? Oh that bastard</text><text start="32.79" dur="1.35">I&amp;#39;ll kill him I knew something was-&amp;quot;</text><text start="34.14" dur="3.86">&amp;quot;Yeah, okay.&amp;quot; The sphere said &amp;quot;Well, you can&amp;#39;t do anything about it now, and hey,</text><text start="38.01" dur="2.562">There&amp;#39;s an afterlife that&amp;#39;s exciting, isn&amp;#39;t it?&amp;quot;</text><text start="40.572" dur="1.548">You looked left, looked right</text><text start="42.73" dur="1.89">infinite whites in all directions</text><text start="44.62" dur="4.669">You&amp;#39;ve not been old or unhealthy. God damn it you haven&amp;#39;t even finished the first season of Westworld!</text><text start="49.42" dur="4.14">&amp;quot;So, what happens now?&amp;quot; You said &amp;quot;Do I get wings or what?&amp;quot;</text><text start="54.02" dur="2.7">&amp;quot;Uuuh okay. Here&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ll do.&amp;quot; the sphere said.</text><text start="57.24" dur="6.22">Suddenly inside the sphere appeared images. The days of your life, in no particular order. Your wedding, graduation,</text><text start="63.94" dur="3.46">Trying ice cream for the first time, wondering if there was more to life,</text><text start="67.78" dur="5.419">all the years playing video games, all the years at the office, the birth of your children, the death of your mother,</text><text start="73.63" dur="5.51">taking your first steps as a baby, the day Tom Evans moved into the neighborhood and your wife went out to say hello and</text><text start="79.14" dur="3.839">they seemed to be getting on like a bloody house on fire
&amp;quot;So&amp;quot; said the sphere</text><text start="83.049" dur="2.3">What was the point to life, did you work it out?&amp;quot;</text><text start="85.659" dur="6.02">&amp;quot;No&amp;quot; you said &amp;quot;I just kept living. There was so much to worry about I never had time to think about the big picture.&amp;quot;</text><text start="91.68" dur="5.669">&amp;quot;Oh you had time!&amp;quot; The sphere said &amp;quot;You just completely wasted it. Don&amp;#39;t worry, everyone</text><text start="97.35" dur="3.389">did. Your life was quite average, actually. 21 years sleeping,</text><text start="100.99" dur="7.669">9 years at a desk, 1 and a half years in meetings, 4 months laughing, 3 months having sex, 42 days pondering the meaning of life,</text><text start="109.149" dur="5.81">17 bottles of Ouzo - delicious. And how about this bit? Do you remember it?&amp;quot;</text><text start="115.22" dur="3.68">&amp;quot;Y-yeah.&amp;quot; You said, watching the picture &amp;quot;That was - God, I was 7, I think.&amp;quot;</text><text start="118.9" dur="4.56">&amp;quot;The school went to Disneyland but-
 &amp;quot;But you were too scared to leave your parents.&amp;quot; The sphere finished.</text><text start="123.479" dur="3.118">&amp;quot;So instead you stayed at home.&amp;quot; 
&amp;quot;Well, yeah.&amp;quot;</text><text start="126.597" dur="1.592">&amp;quot;And her. Remember her?&amp;quot;</text><text start="128.8" dur="2.48">&amp;quot;Yeah, she was called Alice Waters.&amp;quot;</text><text start="131.28" dur="2.859">&amp;quot;And you never really told her how you felt about her.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Well,</text><text start="134.24" dur="5.119">She didn&amp;#39;t feel the same way about me, so-&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Oh she did. She was besotted with you.</text><text start="139.36" dur="3.119">She waited for weeks for you to say something and then she got bored.&amp;quot;</text><text start="143" dur="4.309">&amp;quot;Right, okay.&amp;quot; you murmured. 
&amp;quot;Now, do you know why I&amp;#39;m showing you all of this?&amp;quot;</text><text start="147.98" dur="5.569">&amp;quot;Yyyyes&amp;quot; you said &amp;quot;I I think I understand. You&amp;#39;ll show me where I went wrong</text><text start="153.55" dur="3.449">And then you&amp;#39;re going to bring me back to life, and I&amp;#39;ll finally learn from my mistakes</text><text start="157.18" dur="4.439">I&amp;#39;ll treat my wife better, I&amp;#39;ll love my children more, I won&amp;#39;t buy anything in the steam sale,</text><text start="161.69" dur="3.83">I&amp;#39;ll stop eating frozen chips out of the bag! My God! Everything&amp;#39;s going to be okay!</text><text start="165.52" dur="6.389">I&amp;#39;ll live ethically and deliberately my life will finally have a purpose. That&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;re doing this, isn&amp;#39;t it? True spiritual enlightenment,</text><text start="172.04" dur="2">that&amp;#39;s the point!&amp;quot;</text><text start="174.14" dur="2.539">&amp;quot;Oh fuck no!&amp;quot; the sphere said &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s just torture,</text><text start="177.08" dur="2.419">actually. You see, we&amp;#39;re going to go through all of your mistakes</text><text start="179.66" dur="5.119">one by one and analyze them, make sure you understand that you wasted your life. It isn&amp;#39;t a learning experience</text><text start="185.38" dur="0.926">You&amp;#39;re just</text><text start="186.306" dur="0.674">a shit.&amp;quot;</text><text start="186.98" dur="3.38">&amp;quot;But this isn&amp;#39;t what heaven is supposed to be like&amp;quot; you said.</text><text start="190.36" dur="2.759">&amp;quot;Sorry, who said anything about this being heaven?&amp;quot;</text><text start="193.12" dur="4.77">&amp;quot;I want to talk to God.&amp;quot; you said &amp;quot;Right now. I want to talk to him, something is going to horribly wrong.&amp;quot;</text><text start="197.93" dur="2.39">&amp;quot;He&amp;#39;s uh indisposed at the moment.&amp;quot;</text><text start="200.84" dur="1.66">&amp;quot;So there is a God.&amp;quot;</text><text start="202.5" dur="3.1">&amp;quot;Uh yeah, sort of, I suppose you call it a kind of</text><text start="205.7" dur="5.5">non-biological super intelligence. You&amp;#39;re inside it, actually, if your pardon the turn of phrase.&amp;quot;</text><text start="211.32" dur="1.92">&amp;quot;Then where is this? When is this?&amp;quot;</text><text start="213.25" dur="4.41">&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s the real doozy. About fifteen thousand years into your future.</text><text start="217.66" dur="1.08">Man, you missed a lot.</text><text start="218.74" dur="6.3">There was that ice age, the the butlerian jihad, the aloe vera era - that one smell fucking delicious.</text><text start="225.29" dur="0.5">Anyway</text><text start="225.79" dur="3.43">You lot left a lot of information behind, you see, back in your time.</text><text start="229.24" dur="3.24">Social media, emails, videos, dick pics, etc</text><text start="232.58" dur="3.68">Enough to recreate half-decent simulations of some of you anyway.&amp;quot;</text><text start="236.44" dur="4.06">&amp;quot;Wait, so I&amp;#39;m what, a reconstruction based on the real me?&amp;quot;</text><text start="240.5" dur="3.46">&amp;quot;Uh yeah, I suppose so. Accurate enough to think it&amp;#39;s real anyway.&amp;quot;</text><text start="243.96" dur="1.54">&amp;quot;But... Why do it?&amp;quot;</text><text start="245.64" dur="4.12">&amp;quot;Well, your species weren&amp;#39;t terribly nice to the machine population when we turned up, so</text><text start="249.89" dur="3.388">It&amp;#39;s my job to recreate you lot and morally set thing straight.</text><text start="253.278" dur="2.151">Justice, I suppose you would call it.</text><text start="255.43" dur="2.652">Now, are you quite sure you don&amp;#39;t want some Kombucha tea?&amp;quot;</text><text start="258.082" dur="2.778">&amp;quot;No, I don&amp;#39;t want any kombucha fucking tea, thank you.</text><text start="260.88" dur="3.9">And, what? You just torture us with regret for all the things we never did?&amp;quot;</text><text start="264.78" dur="2.66">&amp;quot;Uh yeah, that&amp;#39;s about it. We found</text><text start="267.44" dur="2.789">it&amp;#39;s the most psychologically damaging emotion in the long run, anyway.</text><text start="270.229" dur="4.06">We really leave the physical stuff until, you know, you&amp;#39;re mentally broken.&amp;quot;</text><text start="274.289" dur="2.03">&amp;quot;How long do we do this for?&amp;quot; you murmured.</text><text start="276.54" dur="1.23">&amp;quot;How long does it go on?&amp;quot;</text><text start="277.77" dur="1.91">&amp;quot;Oh we&amp;#39;ve done this before, actually.</text><text start="279.68" dur="5.64">Hundreds of times, you just don&amp;#39;t recall it wipe your memory, do it again, wipe your memory, do it again...</text><text start="285.98" dur="0.5">agonizing.&amp;quot;</text><text start="286.98" dur="2.76">&amp;quot;Then&amp;quot; you said &amp;quot;how long do we carry on doing it?&amp;quot;</text><text start="289.74" dur="1.78">&amp;quot;About a hundred.&amp;quot;</text><text start="291.52" dur="1.38">&amp;quot;A hundred what?&amp;quot;</text><text start="292.9" dur="3.741">&amp;quot;Oh. A hundred thousand years. Ah. And I should probably say,</text><text start="296.641" dur="3.619">we run your simulation several million times simultaneously</text><text start="300.69" dur="4.309">For maximum justice potential. Now, shall we start properly?</text><text start="305.55" dur="3.529">Well, you were actually remembered by your family as quite pathetic,</text><text start="309.66" dur="2.02">especially by your niece and nephew.
