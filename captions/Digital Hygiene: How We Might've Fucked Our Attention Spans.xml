dur="2.52">and I&amp;#39;m going to suggest a remedy.</text><text start="5.72" dur="4.22">Like me, until recently, you may find that while you planned to have a productive Saturday,</text><text start="9.94" dur="0.86">you instead spent it on</text><text start="10.8" dur="0.58">Youtube,</text><text start="11.38" dur="0.94">and Facebook,</text><text start="12.32" dur="1.26">and Agar.io,</text><text start="13.58" dur="1.16">and ï»¿o t h e r  s i t e s,</text><text start="14.74" dur="1.12">and got nothing done.</text><text start="15.86" dur="1.3">WHY?</text><text start="17.16" dur="4.14">Well, it&amp;#39;s because the internet is absurdly addictive, and can cater to anything,</text><text start="21.3" dur="0.88">ANYTHING,</text><text start="22.18" dur="1">you want to see.</text><text start="23.32" dur="1.04">And that&amp;#39;s wonderful.</text><text start="24.62" dur="0.5">However...</text><text start="25.64" dur="3.1">At the advanced, practically terminal age of twenty-seven,</text><text start="28.74" dur="1.88">I remember a time when the internet was a luxury.</text><text start="30.62" dur="4.44">And if you were on the internet, friends couldn&amp;#39;t phone your house, so you used it sparingly.</text><text start="35.06" dur="6.14">People in chatrooms were polite, (usually), even the creepy old men, because it felt like you were part of some new frontier</text><text start="41.2" dur="1.8">that was going to change the world.</text><text start="43" dur="4.36">The Net was a tool back then that you usually only turned on to do something specific with</text><text start="47.84" dur="1.36">and it was, amazing.</text><text start="49.46" dur="3.92">Now, the Net is incredibly sophisticated, and you can do bloody anything with it.</text><text start="53.38" dur="4.3">However, this also came with a downside that looked like an upside.</text><text start="57.68" dur="4.32">Which is that most of us are permanently connected to it, via our phones.</text><text start="62" dur="6.46">Just as I am guilty of, you may find that in the morning, before even brushing your teeth, or making a cup of coffee, you check your e-mails.</text><text start="68.46" dur="3.16">And if you think about it, that&amp;#39;s kind of fucking crazy.</text><text start="72.12" dur="1.38">You may have also noticed,</text><text start="73.5" dur="1.38">again, like me,</text><text start="74.88" dur="4.5">that reading books, or listening to a whole album, or just trying to learning a new skill that doesn&amp;#39;t involve a screen,</text><text start="79.38" dur="2.98">is substantially more difficult than it used to be.</text><text start="82.36" dur="2.22">And half way through, you just give up and check Reddit,</text><text start="84.58" dur="0.5">over,</text><text start="85.08" dur="0.5">and over,</text><text start="85.58" dur="0.76">for no good reason.</text><text start="86.34" dur="1.82">(shoutout to /r/accidentalrenaissance)</text><text start="88.32" dur="2.4">So here&amp;#39;s my baseless conjecture.</text><text start="90.72" dur="4.9">I reckon the Net, and phones in general, have seriously diminished human attention spans,</text><text start="95.62" dur="3.9">to the point where we now expect almost immediate gratification for performing tasks.</text><text start="100" dur="2.44">And when a book gets a bit boring, as they usually do,</text><text start="102.44" dur="3.54">or playing an instrument is tough, or we get stuck alone with our own thoughts,</text><text start="105.98" dur="0.62">...god forbid...</text><text start="106.6" dur="5.86">we switch to doing something mediocre online rather than persevering with something difficult in the real world.</text><text start="112.46" dur="1.58">That is un-good.</text><text start="114.04" dur="1.92">So, around a month ago, I thought,</text><text start="115.96" dur="1.1">&amp;quot;Well, this is jolly silly,&amp;quot;</text><text start="117.06" dur="1.26">and set some ground rules.</text><text start="118.56" dur="5.68">For the next month, I&amp;#39;d spend an hour in the morning answering e-mails, quickly check the news, check my life online,</text><text start="124.24" dur="1.42">(because that is my job)</text><text start="125.66" dur="2.5">but then I&amp;#39;d just unplug the router for the rest of the day.</text><text start="128.16" dur="2.46">And I didn&amp;#39;t plug it back in until the next morning.</text><text start="131.02" dur="2.78">I went and bought a load of books I&amp;#39;ve been meaning to read for ages,</text><text start="133.8" dur="1.92">made an effort to go see friends in the evening,</text><text start="135.72" dur="4.98">and every Saturday or so I&amp;#39;d go back through my subscriptions and have a watch of Youtubers I was really into.</text><text start="140.7" dur="2.94">And the internet began to feel like a treat again.</text><text start="143.64" dur="2.46">For the first day, or two, it was a bit weird,</text><text start="146.1" dur="3.72">and I could feel there was a kind of instinct to reach for my laptop everytime I felt bored.</text><text start="149.82" dur="3.66">But soon enough your brain works out that there&amp;#39;s no point, because it knows it&amp;#39;s:</text><text start="153.48" dur="2">No Wifi o&amp;#39;clock motherfucker!</text><text start="155.56" dur="8.64">And sure enough, tasks requiring concentration get easier, because you learn that you can&amp;#39;t just escape into the lovely, fuzzy, warm oblivion of the internet.</text><text start="164.34" dur="6.42">And on top of that, you realize, or I certainly did, that for a very long time now, you&amp;#39;ve been sacrificing productive time,</text><text start="170.76" dur="2.38">or just an hour to have a think about your life,</text><text start="173.14" dur="4.14">for the sake of watching something you don&amp;#39;t really give a shit about, out of fear of being bored.</text><text start="177.28" dur="4.36">Fast food is delicious, but you&amp;#39;re not supposed to eat it for *every fucking meal*!</text><text start="182.32" dur="7.42">If you&amp;#39;d&amp;#39;te describe the internet to anyone before the nineties, they would have assumed we&amp;#39;d be living in a techno-utopia, and that everything would be amazing.</text><text start="189.74" dur="3.04">And like all technology, they probably wouldn&amp;#39;t have predicted,</text><text start="192.78" dur="3.34">that this big lovely binary cake comes with some downsides.</text><text start="196.46" dur="3.58">Now we have two personas to manage, our real one, and our digital one.</text><text start="200.04" dur="1.92">Snail mail has been replaced with digital mail,</text><text start="201.96" dur="2">(which people get angry with if you don&amp;#39;t answer immediately),</text><text start="203.96" dur="6.94">and instantaneous transfer of information has given rise to immediate boredom with anything that doesn&amp;#39;t have a hook in the first ten seconds.</text><text start="211.24" dur="0.54">Try it.</text><text start="212.08" dur="7.3">For a month, or just a week, use the internet as a tool again, rather than a source of constant gratification, if that&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;re doing now.</text><text start="219.38" dur="3.06">Set some rules. If you work from home, download a site blocker.</text><text start="222.44" dur="2.78">Take up a hobby in the outside world that you&amp;#39;ve always wanted to.</text><text start="225.22" dur="2.7">Start watercolour painting!  (Pinky promise, it&amp;#39;s worth it)</text><text start="227.92" dur="5.4">More than that, there&amp;#39;s probably something you&amp;#39;ve always wanted to get into, or a project you&amp;#39;ve always wanted to finish.</text><text start="233.7" dur="1.12">Why not do it now?</text><text start="235.22" dur="5.22">You&amp;#39;d be amazed what you can concentrate on when you&amp;#39;re suddenly not obliged to check what everyone&amp;#39;s been having for lunch that day,</text><text start="240.44" dur="2.06">or what certain presidents have been tweeting recently.</text><text start="242.7" dur="2.84">It&amp;#39;s a bit worrying if this is a growing trend.</text><text start="245.54" dur="3.78">I know people who can&amp;#39;t sit through movies without playing Candy Crush or checking Twitter.</text><text start="249.32" dur="5.6">Games, and the Net, are only going to get more alluring as time goes on.  The problem isn&amp;#39;t going away.</text><text start="254.92" dur="3.64">We&amp;#39;re getting extremely good at hijacking the reward centers of human brains.</text><text start="258.56" dur="5.08">Combine that with virtual reality, or whatever&amp;#39;s coming next, and that is a kind of scary prospect.</text><text start="263.64" dur="2.78">In the same way that you wash your hands after using the toilet,</text><text start="266.42" dur="0.72">*HOPEFULLY*</text><text start="267.14" dur="8">we might one day start teaching digital hygiene, where we all learn to keep our concentration on one thing at a time, rather than running 10,000 tabs all at once,</text><text start="275.16" dur="1.74">ALL OF WHICH ARE CATS</text><text start="276.98" dur="7.5">So, for a month, I dare you to step back from the Net, and go after whatever it is that you&amp;#39;ve always wanted to do in real life, but couldn&amp;#39;t find the time.</text><text start="284.48" dur="1.96">Read some books, learn to bake,</text><text start="286.44" dur="1.74">get your camel riding license,</text><text start="288.18" dur="0.64">whatever.</text><text start="288.82" dur="3.42">Attention is a resource, and we only have a limited supply,</text><text start="292.24" dur="7.04">and it&amp;#39;s silly to spend that resource on things that may temporarily stop us from being bored, but don&amp;#39;t really provide any mental nourishment.</text><text start="299.58" dur="1.76">...Much like my Youtube content!</text><text start="301.34" dur="0.66">Bye</text></transcript>
