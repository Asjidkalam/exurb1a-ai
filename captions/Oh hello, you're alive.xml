the world, have a seat because you can&amp;#39;t walk yet.</text><text start="4.94" dur="2.3">You&amp;#39;re gonna spend the next few
years in the psychedelic world of colors</text><text start="7.259" dur="2.611">that make no sense but it&amp;#39;s alright
because you can pee yourself and somebody</text><text start="9.87" dur="2.25">will probably sort it out for you but
don&amp;#39;t get used to it, soon they&amp;#39;ll be</text><text start="12.12" dur="2.55">expecting you to use the toilet, so make
the most of it, and not long after that</text><text start="14.67" dur="2.939">you have to go to a building where they&amp;#39;ll make
you learn stuff and prove you know it like</text><text start="17.609" dur="1.59">times tables and the alphabet and whatnot.</text><text start="19.199" dur="2.16">Maybe you still think you are the center
of the world and you can probably get</text><text start="21.359" dur="2.641">away with that for a while - some people
do their entire lives - but eventually</text><text start="24" dur="2.4">you&amp;#39;re going to start pissing other kids off so
you probably gonna have to learn some</text><text start="26.4" dur="1.11">humility soon, too.</text><text start="27.51" dur="3.359">Got it? Good, all right. Then you&amp;#39;re gonna
go to another building where the tests are a</text><text start="30.869" dur="2.731">bit harder and the subjects are more
intense. They try to teach you stuff like</text><text start="33.6" dur="3.24">trigonometry and iambic pentameter without
ever actually explaining what you can use</text><text start="36.84" dur="2.73">it for but don&amp;#39;t worry, just memorize it
and spit it out and forget it the second</text><text start="39.57" dur="2.85">you walk out of the exam hall. By now
you&amp;#39;re probably getting weird urges to</text><text start="42.42" dur="2.94">do stuff to your classmates that you never
really wanted to do before and now</text><text start="45.36" dur="1.92">you&amp;#39;re gonna have to play a game for
the rest of your life where you really</text><text start="47.28" dur="2.67">want this kind of closeness with people
but sometimes not everybody feels</text><text start="49.95" dur="2.37">mutually, so you&amp;#39;re going to have to hide it.</text><text start="52.32" dur="3.509">Welcome to the world of dating and
body language and sex. Yeah, you&amp;#39;re gonna like the</text><text start="55.829" dur="2.521">last one, it&amp;#39;s going to dictate your life
and most of the films you watch and</text><text start="58.35" dur="2.88">book you read for some time to come  
whether you realize it or not.</text><text start="61.23" dur="3.24">Oh you&amp;#39;re finished spitting out all that
rote memorization well great let&amp;#39;s go</text><text start="64.47" dur="0.839">to university.</text><text start="65.309" dur="2.701">You need to if you want to earn lots of
money which is obviously very important</text><text start="68.01" dur="2.55">because well, well it just is shut up!</text><text start="70.56" dur="3.599">Look, everyone&amp;#39;s happy when they&amp;#39;re rich. Pick
a subject, not the humanities you idiot,</text><text start="74.159" dur="4.171">something real like law or maths. I didn&amp;#39;t spent 18
years raising fucking philosophy major</text><text start="78.33" dur="3.3">cogito ergo broke all the time. Oh you
finished? Great, well it&amp;#39;s off to the</text><text start="81.63" dur="2.76">companies for you then. Tell them you&amp;#39;re a
people person and you have excellent</text><text start="84.39" dur="2.729">organizational skills and you work well in a
team.</text><text start="87.119" dur="2.881">Don&amp;#39;t mention your actual passions for
landscape gardening or music, they don&amp;#39;t give a</text><text start="90" dur="0.6">shit.</text><text start="90.6" dur="3.21">just come off as generic as possible,
stick it out for about 30 years, you&amp;#39;ll make</text><text start="93.81" dur="1.05">good money in time.</text><text start="94.86" dur="2.7">Only the sex thing is probably getting a
little empty by now and you&amp;#39;re craving</text><text start="97.56" dur="4.14">some kind of actual connection with the
opposite sex or same sex if that&amp;#39;s your thing.</text><text start="101.7" dur="2.73">Jesus, you thought getting people to take
their clothes off is difficult, you try</text><text start="104.43" dur="2.52">finding a partner to fall in love with. And
even then, what if they get bored or you</text><text start="106.95" dur="3.239">get bored or they go off with the milkman or
something, well sorry you&amp;#39;re just gonna</text><text start="110.189" dur="3.091">have to risk it like everyone else. Like
life, actually.</text><text start="113.28" dur="3.78">Some people are dead by your age but
you&amp;#39;re not. No, you&amp;#39;re still sad in a pit</text><text start="117.06" dur="3.48">of your own mediocrity feeling dull and
stepped on by life, standing on a rock</text><text start="120.54" dur="3.42">that&amp;#39;s spinning at 9,000 miles an hour around
a gas giant in an infinite universe, a product of</text><text start="123.96" dur="3.33">13 billion years of cosmic evolution but
no, no, definitely you carry on being</text><text start="127.29" dur="0.68">bored and feeling</text><text start="127.97" dur="2.22">like crap. And you now you feel worse
because you know how great you should</text><text start="130.19" dur="2.34">feel about everything, amazed and happy
all the time</text><text start="132.53" dur="3.36">and yet you still feel like shit. Well,
that&amp;#39;s biology. Well, maybe your friend&amp;#39;s</text><text start="135.89" dur="3.24">getting rich or getting married or getting
pregnant or something and you&amp;#39;re poor and</text><text start="139.13" dur="1.83">single and maybe you don&amp;#39;t want kids,</text><text start="140.96" dur="2.76">it doesn&amp;#39;t matter what Carl Sagan says,
you don&amp;#39;t feel any sense of wonder</text><text start="143.72" dur="1.23">at all, you feel like shit,</text><text start="144.95" dur="2.58">you don&amp;#39;t want eloquent prose about how
beautiful the cosmos is you want money</text><text start="147.53" dur="2.1">to live comfortably or you want to be in
love</text><text start="149.63" dur="3.21">and maybe you want children. Try books, there&amp;#39;s
quite a few dead guys who are willing to</text><text start="152.84" dur="2.4">claim they can explain what you&amp;#39;re doing
here and how you can be happy but loads of</text><text start="155.24" dur="3.48">them just contradict each other and to
be honest it all comes down to you.</text><text start="158.72" dur="2.73">You&amp;#39;re going to have to decide whether
you believe in God or want to eat meat</text><text start="161.45" dur="3.06">or support abortion or feel that life
has intrinsic meaning and whatever you</text><text start="164.51" dur="3.18">do people, will shit on your opinions and
tell you you&amp;#39;re delusional.</text><text start="168.2" dur="3.36">Sorry, it&amp;#39;s a game with no winners. And
now you&amp;#39;re old and maybe you&amp;#39;ve got</text><text start="171.56" dur="2.64">money and maybe you haven&amp;#39;t, same with a
partner and child, and now you&amp;#39;re two</text><text start="174.2" dur="2.16">steps from death and you spend a lot of time
thinking about what you could have done</text><text start="176.36" dur="3.24">and Jennifer Smith in the fields behind
your parents&amp;#39; house when you were both 17</text><text start="179.6" dur="1.8">and how you should&amp;#39;ve said I love you</text><text start="181.4" dur="2.61">and instead you said look I&amp;#39;m sorry I&amp;#39;m
just not in the best place right now,</text><text start="184.01" dur="1.47">come on, it&amp;#39;s getting cold.</text><text start="185.48" dur="3.06">Well, no use thinking about it now. Jennifer is
probably old and doddery just like you</text><text start="188.54" dur="2.04">are. Not much time left.</text><text start="190.58" dur="3.09">Well, I guess i&amp;#39;ll just do it all again
differently the next time.</text><text start="193.67" dur="3.69">Oh, there - there isn&amp;#39;t a next time? Oh that - that was it?</text><text start="197.36" dur="3.72">Shit, I&amp;#39;d wish I had known because if I&amp;#39;d
known that this was the one chance I</text><text start="201.08" dur="2.52">have to live as a talking monkey in
space at the best point in history as</text><text start="203.6" dur="1.44">the smartest species on the planet</text><text start="205.04" dur="2.49">using fucking magic on a daily basis
like the internet and jet planes and</text><text start="207.53" dur="2.52">smartphones with access to all human
knowledge at my fingertips and the</text><text start="210.05" dur="2.31">chance to talk about how cool being
alive is I might have not worried so much</text><text start="212.36" dur="3.15">about what other people thought and their shitty
lives, and I might have just spent what little</text><text start="215.51" dur="2.759">time there was making good art or doing good science or falling in love or</text><text start="218.269" dur="1.47">just not being a dick.</text><text start="219.739" dur="4.051">Oh well, if only I&amp;#39;d known. Which I did
but i just don&amp;#39;t really want to think</text><text start="223.79" dur="0.72">about it.</text><text start="224.51" dur="1.38">Oh humm, so it goes.</text></transcript>
