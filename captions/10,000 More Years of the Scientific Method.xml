you learn one,</text><text start="226.62" dur="1.72">You can read people&amp;#39;s fucking minds.</text><text start="228.34" dur="2.4">And this technology took thousands of years to build.</text><text

dur="3.42">Most language processing takes place in the cerebral cortex, we think.</text><text start="237.84" dur="3.56">Adult native speakers usually know about twenty thousand to thirty five thousand words,</text><text start="241.4" dur="2.06">But there&amp;#39;s plenty of people who speak multiple languages,</text><text start="243.46" dur="2.26">So closer to sixty thousand words or more.</text><text start="245.72" dur="2.12">And did we find language at the top of a mountain?</text><text start="247.84" dur="1.46">Or in a drawer or some shit?</text><text start="249.3" dur="2.06">Oh no, clever dead people gave it to us.</text><text start="251.36" dur="1.3">And talking of deaf people,</text><text start="252.66" dur="2.26">The difference between our ancestors and us?</text><text start="254.92" dur="2.18">Well, mainly reason and rationality.</text><text start="257.1" dur="2.28">Look, there&amp;#39;s a good story about Descartes.</text><text start="259.38" dur="2.76">He was one of the fathers of the scientific method, basically.</text><text start="262.14" dur="1.88">And one night he had a bunch of wacky dreams,</text><text start="264.02" dur="3.5">And in one of them an angel came to him, apparently, and said:</text><text start="267.52" dur="3.82">&amp;quot;The conquest of nature is to be achieved through number and measure.&amp;quot;</text><text start="271.34" dur="4.66">And that, surely, has to be one of, if not THE most powerful ideas we&amp;#39;ve ever had:</text><text start="276" dur="1.68">Scientific objectivity.</text><text start="277.68" dur="2.1">Nature can be understood using mathematics,</text><text start="279.78" dur="1.82">Then controlled using technology.</text><text start="281.6" dur="2.62">And as long as we remember that the world isn&amp;#39;t in our heads,</text><text start="284.22" dur="1.6">That the universe has a character,</text><text start="285.82" dur="3.6">Well, there may be no limit to what will one day be capable of with technology.</text><text start="289.5" dur="2.22">Rationality is absurdly powerful.</text><text start="291.72" dur="2.18">It&amp;#39;s the reason we&amp;#39;re not sitting around in our own excrement.</text><text start="293.9" dur="3.54">It&amp;#39;s the reason the average high-schooler knows more about the world than the smartest human did</text><text start="297.44" dur="1.3">Not a few hundred years ago.</text><text start="298.74" dur="3.24">It&amp;#39;s the reason lots of us are living better than every emperor in history.</text><text start="301.98" dur="2.24">And Jesus Christ, look what we&amp;#39;ve done already!</text><text start="304.22" dur="2.4">Antibiotics, or moldy bread in essence,</text><text start="306.62" dur="3.18">Has probably saved about 200 million lives since it was discovered.</text><text start="309.8" dur="2.8">Your phone has more computing power than all of the computers</text><text start="312.6" dur="1.96">That NASA used to send humans to the moon.</text><text start="314.56" dur="3.16">And scientists are now using lasers to listen to black hole collisions</text><text start="317.72"
