<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.28" dur="2.42">I lived once on the ocean floor,</text><text start="2.7" dur="2.44">All robot help and sliding doors,</text><text start="5.14" dur="1.94">And thought seldom of the shore.</text><text start="7.08" dur="3.64">Until I received one night
A letter from my grandfather,</text><text start="10.72" dur="5.08">And the letter read:
&amp;quot;Dear Empty Head,
Ye who dwell on ocean&amp;#39;s bed,</text><text start="15.8" dur="4.4">I send this by the cracked moon&amp;#39;s light,
It likely be the last I write.</text><text start="20.2" dur="4.18">I&amp;#39;ll take soon flight
For a long journey&amp;#39;s while
To the Ninth Isle,</text><text start="24.38" dur="4.54">Remember me as I will you,
All tree houses and untied shoe,</text><text start="28.92" dur="4.74">In hope someday we meet again,
Your distant kin, Sebastian.&amp;quot;</text><text start="33.66" dur="5.62">But a farewell by letter is little better
Than no farewell at all, so on a young man&amp;#39;s whim,</text><text start="39.28" dur="3.32">For my grandfather, I set off in search of him...</text><text start="43.18" dur="2.34">I left by quiet my stately keep,</text><text start="45.52" dur="2.12">The escape was easy, guards asleep,</text><text start="47.64" dur="4.46">And wandered &amp;#39;bout on tiptoe feet,
The tall glass halls and cold steel streets,</text><text start="52.1" dur="2.54">And found, at last, an airlock,</text><text start="54.64" dur="4.08">But for love or none
Could find no life suit or aqualung.</text><text start="58.72" dur="1.78">So, deep breath then,</text><text start="60.5" dur="2.16">I go to find Sebastian.</text><text start="62.66" dur="4.02">Then airlock open,
And off into the freezing hug of the dark ocean,</text><text start="66.68" dur="4.46">And struggling up, heart kicking like a drum then,
Limbs and lungs all done then,</text><text start="71.14" dur="2.3">And the next thing I knew, I woke again.</text><text start="73.44" dur="6.34">All gasping and flail, and wet as whales, 
And most pinned by wind
And water, a storm, ye, a storm,</text><text start="79.78" dur="2.46">Hell&amp;#39;s teeth, and I at the center.</text><text start="82.24" dur="6.22">And I, swimming as though possessed,
And I, to die, and senses arrested,
And kick my legs in fit of fear</text><text start="88.46" dur="4.34">And knew no north from south or my mouth from my arse, as I rolled about in the water.</text><text start="92.8" dur="3.28">But God, air, and true wind on my face,</text><text start="96.08" dur="3.02">For I had not known such a thing
In all my remembering,</text><text start="99.1" dur="5.7">And though I might well drown and sink true down to the ocean floor once more in but a minute&amp;#39;s stem,</text><text start="104.8" dur="4.88">For this moment, swirling in those salt eddies, I was a boy again.</text><text start="109.68" dur="5.06">And stormy though the night was hung,
Beyond that storm, I knew, the Sun.</text><text start="114.74" dur="4.14">Nay, but I was still at fate&amp;#39;s behest, and had no interest in the valley of death,</text><text start="118.88" dur="2.52">And by width and breadth did trial about a long while,</text><text start="121.4" dur="3.84">And the water did carry me along and put my soul and breath asunder,</text><text start="125.24" dur="2.76">So this is how it ends, the long going under.</text><text start="128" dur="3.94">And with water in my mouth, goodnight.
Yes, give up air and everywhere,</text><text start="131.94" dur="3.82">Yes, goodnight. I go to seek a water sleep.</text><text start="136.22" dur="3.72">But fate was hard at play
And I woke again, this time day,</text><text start="139.94" dur="3.46">The storm a year away
So far as the sky told that story,</text><text start="143.4" dur="3.88">A beach whereupon the sea had spat me out like some dislikeable pip.</text><text start="147.28" dur="6.22">And I alive and washed ashore with bones and balls all sore,
And what&amp;#39;s more, there in the sky&amp;#39;s maw</text><text start="153.5" dur="2.98">Was the moon in cracked spoils of dead rock,</text><text start="156.48" dur="3.6">As though God Himself had struck it with his mighty Galactic co-</text><text start="160.08" dur="4.78">But nay, there a man approached along the sand and called to see if I was all right.</text><text start="164.86" dur="2.38">And his face became familiar of a sudden.</text><text start="167.24" dur="1.64">&amp;quot;Grandfather?&amp;quot; I said.</text><text start="168.88" dur="4">&amp;quot;Err, no?&amp;quot; replied he with concerned eyes on me and continued,</text><text start="172.88" dur="4.38">&amp;quot;Sir, whatever ordeal you&amp;#39;ve just been through
Has perhaps relieved the sense from you.</text><text start="177.26" dur="1.48">May I ask your name?&amp;quot;</text><text start="178.74" dur="4.9">And though I did my best not to show it –
My name, I realized, I did not know it.</text><text start="183.64" dur="3.06">And my companion helped me to my feet, led me down the beach,</text><text start="186.7" dur="3.32">And I walked bent double,
Still reeling from the morning&amp;#39;s trouble.</text><text start="190.02" dur="2.26">Then said he, checking my memory,</text><text start="192.28" dur="1.9">&amp;quot;And how old is your grandfather?&amp;quot;</text><text start="194.18" dur="5.44">Said I, &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t recall at all. Perhaps you&amp;#39;re right, I&amp;#39;m rattled slight from the ocean.&amp;quot;</text><text start="199.62" dur="3.06">&amp;quot;Okay,&amp;quot; he said, &amp;quot;then which island is it you&amp;#39;re from?&amp;quot;</text><text start="202.68" dur="1.94">&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not from an island,&amp;quot; I said.</text><text start="204.62" dur="3.24">&amp;quot;I hail from beneath the sea and that great aquatic nursery.</text><text start="207.86" dur="7.84">For I am but twenty-one years old,
And from youth&amp;#39;s throws, I escaped the watery below
For one last hour with the man who taught me all I know.&amp;quot;</text><text start="215.7" dur="4.54">And slow he said, &amp;quot;But you are too young. You shouldn&amp;#39;t be above the water.</text><text start="220.24" dur="3.78">Not until their one-hundredth year
Can nursery folk yet come up here.&amp;quot;</text><text start="224.02" dur="4.56">I only avoided his chiding stare
And took great gulps of salt sea air.</text><text start="228.58" dur="5">Finally he said, &amp;quot;I think it best we find this grandfather of yours and get you to safe keeping.</text><text start="233.58" dur="3.32">No isle is distant, mind,
And I&amp;#39;ve a vehicle of my own design.</text><text start="236.9" dur="2.22">Come along. We&amp;#39;ll make it wherever together.&amp;quot;</text><text start="239.12" dur="2.92">And he led me to some great balloon whereupon we got in,</text><text start="242.04" dur="4.54">And though he touched no gauge or board,
The craft set off of its own accord.</text><text start="246.58" dur="6.2">We were out over the water then, and I saw the stories were true, so these lands were an archipelago,</text><text start="252.78" dur="5.12">many islands scattered higgledy here and there, and I shouted to the man,
&amp;quot;Are they a totality?&amp;quot;</text><text start="257.9" dur="3.28">&amp;quot;Nay,&amp;quot; said he, &amp;quot;each is its own little principality,</text><text start="261.18" dur="3.72">And just like your nursery, one lives on the isle fitting of their age –</text><text start="264.9" dur="3.18">As you were too, if the rules you actually obeyed.&amp;quot;</text><text start="268.08" dur="6.1">And pointing then he shouted:
&amp;quot;There that land of birch and oak
Does house those juvenile century folk,</text><text start="274.18" dur="4.38">And there that land with beach and pier
Suits those in their two hundredth year,</text><text start="278.56" dur="3.68">The three hundreders are to the west,
The fourth prefer the forest best,</text><text start="282.24" dur="4.22">And so on, I shan&amp;#39;t recount them all,
We&amp;#39;ve not far to go and our time is small.&amp;quot;</text><text start="286.46" dur="3.46">&amp;quot;Sir,&amp;quot; I said, &amp;quot;with all these folk living so high on time&amp;#39;s shelf,</text><text start="289.92" dur="3.2">I wonder if I might ask you how old you are yourself?&amp;quot;</text><text start="293.12" dur="4.48">And he replied, &amp;quot;Let&amp;#39;s say if there be a tree
That needs watering once a century,</text><text start="297.6" dur="3.48">Then I have filled my watering can eight times so far.&amp;quot;</text><text start="301.08" dur="6.46">I could not help but stare at this man who, ignoring his demeanor,
Appeared physically only five years my senior,</text><text start="307.54" dur="4.54">And in perfect health, but had somehow, eventually, aged eight centuries.</text><text start="312.08" dur="4.5">And before I could comment there appeared, upon the horizon,
Rising up skywards,</text><text start="316.58" dur="3.559">Some needle wound
At least ten thousand feet &amp;#39;bove ground.</text><text start="320.14" dur="2.92">&amp;quot;Vishnu&amp;#39;s arse!&amp;quot; I cried, &amp;quot;What is that?&amp;quot;</text><text start="323.06" dur="4.22">&amp;quot;A tower, whereby,&amp;quot; he did reply,
&amp;quot;It kisses tongues the edge of sky,</text><text start="327.28" dur="3.88">And if you were to reach its spire,
You&amp;#39;d see the breadth of space entire.</text><text start="331.16" dur="5.38">It proves most convenient for ascending objects into orbit without need of fuel or speed.</text><text start="336.54" dur="4.82">And though keep your eyes open yet,&amp;quot; he mumbled slight,
And five seconds hence did see him right,</text><text start="341.36" dur="4.26">For overhead and yonder yet
Were craft wide as twenty jumbo jets,</text><text start="345.62" dur="3.48">Seemingly sitting there in the air by dare of whim.</text><text start="349.1" dur="3.36">&amp;quot;Oh gods, you&amp;#39;re all so clever!&amp;quot; I cried. &amp;quot;You built all of this?&amp;quot;</text><text start="352.46" dur="4.94">&amp;quot;Aye,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;Year to year ascended each
By hammer&amp;#39;s knack and number&amp;#39;s reach.&amp;quot;</text><text start="357.4" dur="5.7">And quite a while we watched the scene,
His face sincere, then turned to me and said, &amp;quot;Young man,</text><text start="363.1" dur="3.32">be honest, What is it you want with your grandfather? Really?</text><text start="366.42" dur="3.1">Are you so bold, you can&amp;#39;t just let the old be old?&amp;quot;</text><text start="369.52" dur="6.2">&amp;quot;Nay,&amp;quot; I said, &amp;quot;I wish to talk with he who by longevitys, like you, has endured the centuries.</text><text start="375.72" dur="3.78">Besides he says he&amp;#39;s going elsewhere and I&amp;#39;d like to follow him there.</text><text start="379.5" dur="4.2">His letter said the Isle of nines If that&amp;#39;s his ground That&amp;#39;s where I&amp;#39;m bound.</text><text start="383.7" dur="3.7">Actually, I wonder if I asked, dare you to get me there.&amp;quot;</text><text start="387.4" dur="3.22">He was quiet a while, pokered face No smiles, and said</text><text start="390.62" dur="3.4">&amp;quot;so you think age leads to becoming some Great Sage do you?</text><text start="394.02" dur="2">Yes, I&amp;#39;ll get you to your grandfather</text><text start="396.02" dur="3.72">But we&amp;#39;ll take the scenic route on our way to the Isle of the nines&amp;quot;</text><text start="399.74" dur="1.4">&amp;quot;Fine,&amp;quot; said I</text><text start="401.14" dur="4.3">our bearing changed then South was bound for some small spit of sandy ground</text><text start="405.44" dur="4.96">&amp;quot;I think,&amp;quot; said he, &amp;quot;we&amp;#39;ll search about and see if we can&amp;#39;t out some of that wisdom you crave&amp;quot;</text><text start="410.4" dur="4.42">and before I could protest we&amp;#39;d set down and come ashore and were bounding over pier floor</text><text start="414.82" dur="5.8">and up then sand and jungle thick and Cut our way with will and stick and emerged before a town</text><text start="420.62" dur="4.54">in the suburbs folk were felling trees and hauling Shore great carts of iron ore</text><text start="425.16" dur="4.8">then further in were folk who looked as young as I and dancing &amp;#39;Neath the broke moon sky</text><text start="429.96" dur="4.12">all necking bottles gin and beer then coupling up to disappear</text><text start="434.08" dur="4.98">which Isle is this, I asked my Friend. I&amp;#39;m barely two decades old they act younger yet.</text><text start="439.06" dur="4.04">The Isle of ones said he all here have aged at least one century</text><text start="443.1" dur="3.74">He left me down the winding paths of open debauchery and open bars</text><text start="446.84" dur="3.06">and folk who clear appeared They slept perhaps three days a year</text><text start="449.9" dur="4.56">and we came upon a woman bare, all dancing legs and wild blonde hair</text><text start="454.46" dur="5.3">My friend proclaimed &amp;quot;Oh Lady mayor I&amp;#39;ve brought for thee one cub straight from the nursery</text><text start="459.76" dur="2.14">and he has questions for his elders&amp;quot;</text><text start="461.9" dur="4.62">She regarded me with red eyes and regard tireder yet and said &amp;quot;nursery, huh?</text><text start="466.52" dur="5.12">Why here we&amp;#39;ve ditched the milk, but kept the bottle, ask away young Aristotle&amp;quot;</text><text start="471.64" dur="5.26">and the music did stop and all folk turned about with their drunk Blair stares poking out</text><text start="476.9" dur="4.04">and the lady mayor of the Isle of ones did close her eyes in great profund</text><text start="480.94" dur="5.18">I murmured &amp;quot;why, I am young and confused about everything and sure of nothing</text><text start="486.12" dur="3.92">but above all I should like to know how does one live well?</text><text start="490.04" dur="2.06">And how does one see far?</text><text start="492.1" dur="3.52">and how does one want for nothing and still acquire everything?&amp;quot;</text><text start="495.62" dur="5.12">I leant sure close and cupped my ear, the wisdom of one in her 100 years</text><text start="500.74" dur="4.64">whereby she replied, &amp;quot;the secret to acquiring everything?

Well</text><text start="509.64" dur="5.38">I&amp;#39;d suggest you found your answer here for we&amp;#39;ve loads of drugs and high strength beer!&amp;quot;</text><text start="515.02" dur="4.22">and though I cried out for Clarification it was surely the end of that conversation</text><text start="519.24" dur="5.36">and my new companion led me back past trees and Lagoon to our waiting bright balloon</text><text start="524.6" dur="2.16">&amp;quot;What,&amp;quot; I said, with confusion fat, &amp;quot;the holy</text><text start="526.76" dur="2.08">Fucking shit was that?&amp;quot;</text><text start="528.84" dur="3.96">and off we left it over the beach up Once again into the wind&amp;#39;s reach.</text><text start="532.8" dur="2.94">&amp;quot;Look,&amp;quot; he said, &amp;quot;True they&amp;#39;re all one century</text><text start="535.74" dur="6.12">But since we live at least nine in these enlightened times they are but teenagers still. Aging is a relative thing</text><text start="541.86" dur="2.9">It wasn&amp;#39;t long after life extension was perfected</text><text start="544.76" dur="6.54">We noticed that the older one dares to grow the more they prefer the company of those in years close to theirs They know</text><text start="551.3" dur="5.58">that is why each age lives on its own isle. You would have little of importance to say to a child</text><text start="556.88" dur="4.14">such is the gap ten times wider with us. So there it is.&amp;quot;</text><text start="561.02" dur="4.3">I said, &amp;quot;&amp;#39;So there it is.&amp;#39; Why, my grandfather liked that phrase also.&amp;quot;</text><text start="565.32" dur="4.12">&amp;quot;That may be,&amp;quot; said he, &amp;quot;and yet your grandfather is not me.&amp;quot;</text><text start="569.44" dur="4.4">And following his dead-end boon, I set eyes upon the fractured moon</text><text start="573.84" dur="4">I said, &amp;quot;Our pale lady of the night is not looking quite right</text><text start="577.84" dur="5.46">what happened to her?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The Fall,&amp;quot; he called. &amp;quot;Why, the world wasn&amp;#39;t always such a peaceable place.</text><text start="583.3" dur="2.42">We once used to play war to keep score.&amp;quot;</text><text start="585.72" dur="4.68">&amp;quot;How does one blow up a moon?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;By being smart enough to build technology that can do so and</text><text start="590.4" dur="2.72">simultaneously stupid enough to use it.</text><text start="593.12" dur="3.28">&amp;quot;Not too long from now, pieces of her will fall to the ground</text><text start="596.4" dur="3.54">and if any of us are still around by then, the air will turn deathly</text><text start="599.94" dur="2.48">and for sure no living thing will endure.</text><text start="602.42" dur="4.02">Save for those living beneath the sea.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Like me,&amp;quot; I said,</text><text start="606.44" dur="3.2">&amp;quot;and what will everyone still above the sea do instead?&amp;quot;</text><text start="609.64" dur="5.24">He said &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ve another destination in mind, where we might start over sensibly this time.&amp;quot;</text><text start="614.88" dur="4.1">With a squint I call sight just slight of rising constructs in the far,</text><text start="618.98" dur="3.84">spires and towers for a crown, sure the mark of a city or town.</text><text start="622.82" dur="2.86">Said I, &amp;quot;Start over where?

Back before science had learned to stand in defiance of aging and death, and almost under his breath</text><text start="669.28" dur="9.08">My old companion said, &amp;quot;The cruel irony is that many folk from that barbaric time still survive today since aging technology went their way</text><text start="678.36" dur="6.2">yet the human brain can only contain so many memories and so as they&amp;#39;ve aged they&amp;#39;ve forgotten the truth</text><text start="684.56" dur="3.02">of what they did to our planet and moon in their youth</text><text start="687.58" dur="5.9">and though the Catastrophes live on in their name they have by quirk of dementia escaped the blame.</text><text start="693.48" dur="1.96">What luck, what shame.&amp;quot;</text><text start="695.44" dur="4.04">I said, &amp;quot;But you assume from the ruins that they knew what they were doing.</text><text start="699.48" dur="5.3">Maybe they meant well with their inventions and broke the world in spite of their best intentions?</text><text start="704.78" dur="8.64">&amp;quot;Right,&amp;quot; he said, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sure in their empty heads when they poisoned the ocean and took their wars to the moon they were really doing it for love and big bright red balloons.&amp;quot;</text><text start="713.42" dur="3.2">And he looked off from our basket a moment and said,</text><text start="716.62" dur="4.66">&amp;quot;Sorry.&amp;quot; Said I, &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t apologize, why, all that anger in your eyes</text><text start="721.28" dur="4.94">makes me just then remember my grandfather&amp;#39;s temper you so resemble him, see.&amp;quot;</text><text start="726.22" dur="4.48">&amp;quot;That may be,&amp;quot; said he, &amp;quot;and yet your grandfather is not me.&amp;quot;</text><text start="731.179" dur="6.721">And I glanced ahead to find we were coming down again, not in a forest this time but a town of some kind.</text><text start="737.9" dur="6.06">Stark marble pillars and great mansions and villas and when we sat down a man came around and said,</text><text start="743.96" dur="4.48">&amp;quot;Welcome friends, why, please enjoy your stay- if you&amp;#39;re going to park on the beach, by the way,</text><text start="748.44" dur="4.28">that&amp;#39;ll be 20,000 shells.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Oh, add it to my tab,&amp;quot; my companion said,</text><text start="752.72" dur="3.6">and with my confusion stark, we pushed on into a park</text><text start="756.32" dur="5.72">at the base of each tree, a sign declared a fee of 10,000 shells for sitting in its shade.</text><text start="762.04" dur="4.24">Likewise looking at the birds would cost the third of what one in a month, made.</text><text start="766.28" dur="5.02">So too were their charges for drinking from the water fountains or stopping to marvel at the mountains.</text><text start="771.3" dur="3.24">and we wandered down ostentatious and spacious streets,</text><text start="774.54" dur="7.94">and found we&amp;#39;d meet with folk tired and thin walking hurried checking their devices greeting each other with declarations of stock prices</text><text start="782.48" dur="6.2">Then pass piles of shells in little Laos and even the dirt and ants have been valued with little price tags</text><text start="788.68" dur="6.3">And we found a great conch shell a man waited outside so thin I wondered if he might already have died</text><text start="794.98" dur="6.1">My companion said sir, Mayor Hello.
