hygiene. 2) Take a long walk now and then</text><text start="5.04" dur="3.84">3) Eat several servings of fruit a day.
4) Don&amp;#39;t drink caffeine before bed.</text><text start="8.88" dur="5.82">5) Attempt to sleep at least seven hours a
night and 6) Accept that he / she is never</text><text start="14.7" dur="4.47">coming back. 7) Accept that the past is
irreparable and dwelling on it will</text><text start="19.17" dur="5.67">change nothing.
8) Dwell on it anyway, and then move on.</text><text start="24.84" dur="5.34">10) Travel alone, if you can. Avoid the
tourist traps, learn one to ten and</text><text start="30.18" dur="2.52">please and thank you in the local
language, and you&amp;#39;ve already surpassed</text><text start="32.7" dur="4.35">90% of all the tourists who have ever
been there before you. 11) Acquire new</text><text start="37.05" dur="3.57">talents for the sake of acquiring them.
If you&amp;#39;re young, learn an instrument if</text><text start="40.62" dur="4.14">possible you will never have this much
free time ever again. 12) Exercise at least</text><text start="44.76" dur="2.7">three times a week-

15) Always check the milk is in date ~fukh~</text><text start="58.02" dur="5.309">16) Always check the lid hasn&amp;#39;t fallen down ~fukhhh~
17) Accept there will be whole weeks</text><text start="63.329" dur="3.721">when you understand nothing and
everything hurts except sometimes stupid</text><text start="67.05" dur="2.73">people get lucky, and sometimes smart people never make it.</text><text start="69.78" dur="3.69">18) Accept that girl in class likely isn&amp;#39;t
going to strike up a conversation first,</text><text start="73.47" dur="3.84">but if you do it will probably go
alright.  20) Accept that just because it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="77.31" dur="1.83">weird,
doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s clever. 21) Accept that</text><text start="79.14" dur="3.75">George Lucas does deserve respects
regardless of the prequels. 22) Accept it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="82.89" dur="3.99">okay if you can&amp;#39;t use chopsticks and
23) Accept that there is a set point in the</text><text start="86.88" dur="3.75">future, after your death when you&amp;#39;ll be
thought about for the final time by a</text><text start="90.63" dur="5.739">friend or family member and then
forgotten from history forever... (unless you become a meme ofc)</text><text start="96.369" dur="3.811">24) Spend more time with your parents if
they&amp;#39;re alive. Even if they are nob-ends,</text><text start="100.18" dur="3.06">there will come a time when they will be
gone, and there will be no one to phone</text><text start="103.24" dur="3.93">home to, no more hugs, no more bickering,
no more in-jokes from your childhood.</text><text start="107.17" dur="3.21">25) Argue about politics if you must, but
accept that the other person won&amp;#39;t</text><text start="110.38" dur="3.09">change their view if you start being a
dick besides even from a tactical</text><text start="113.47" dur="4.05">perspective being nice is always more
likely to persuade someone anyway.</text><text start="117.52" dur="3.57">26) Follow cutting-edge physics if you have the
time. It is the process of humans</text><text start="121.09" dur="4.11">learning to speak fluent universe.  27) Accept
that expensive whiskey is almost always</text><text start="125.2" dur="3.599">worth the money. 28) Accept that expensive
running shoes that almost never worth</text><text start="128.799" dur="3.931">the money. 29) Accept that youtubers and
online personalities are often people</text><text start="132.73" dur="4.02">who couldn&amp;#39;t get into the field they wanted to.
Do not take their word as gospel.</text><text start="136.75" dur="4.319">Especially pretentious advice from
disembodied smart-ass narrators, whose</text><text start="141.069" dur="6.961">life is probably considerably duller
than yours...mhm... 30) Attempt to tolerate meta</text><text start="148.03" dur="4.44">humor? 31) Accept that no one is in charge,
not properly and no one has a handle on</text><text start="152.47" dur="4.62">any of this; Not even Stephen Fry. 32)Avoid the new season of Twin Peaks if you wish</text><text start="157.09" dur="3.75">to conserve your sanity, watch it if not.
33) Come to terms with the fact that there</text><text start="160.84" dur="3.899">is probably no absolute truth that you&amp;#39;ll
grasp in your lifetime. However, if</text><text start="164.739" dur="3.511">someone at the party tries to tell you
everything is relative, invite them to</text><text start="168.25" dur="4.47">exit the building from the 5th floor and
see if gravity is also a social fucking</text><text start="172.72" dur="3.87">construct. 34) Do not be intimidated by
people who use long words- they are</text><text start="176.59" dur="2.489">likely more insecure about their own
intelligence than you are.</text><text start="179.079" dur="3.451">Instead afford them your most
&amp;quot;effervescently magnanimous approbation&amp;quot;</text><text start="182.53" dur="3.6">35) Before tidying up,
make the bed, suddenly everything will</text><text start="186.13" dur="5.16">seem easier. 36) Visit the dentist at regular
intervals. 37) Read Ray Bradbury. Always.</text><text start="191.29" dur="3.15">38) Do not purchase cheap Cellotape. It is about
time someone stuck it to those</text><text start="194.44" dur="4.56">bastards. 39) Embrace your own eccentricity(weirdness)
What made you a freak as a kid, will</text><text start="199" dur="3.18">likely make you an interesting adult.
40) Learn the names and positions of at</text><text start="202.18" dur="5.19">least four constellations. I recommend
Orion, Ursa Minor, Ursa Major, and Cassiopeia.</text><text start="207.37" dur="4.29">This is guaranteed to be useful in a
romantic setting at some point.</text><text start="211.66" dur="4.02">41)Try to eat less salt. 42) Try to eat more vegetables,
43) Try to accept that happiness isn&amp;#39;t a</text><text start="215.68" dur="4.29">constant state, nor does it come for free.
It is a chemical reward for hard work</text><text start="219.97" dur="3.87">and to get more of it one has to do more..
hard work. This applies to careers,</text><text start="223.84" dur="4.28">relationships, friendships, and especially
Factorio™</text><text start="228.12" dur="3.63">44) Diet if you want to, but acknowledge that all
diets- however elaborate- are all</text><text start="231.75" dur="4.769">variations on eat less, move more. 45) Keep a
journal if you have time, it&amp;#39;ll serve as</text><text start="236.519" dur="3">a snapshot for how silly your life
decisions are right now, and you can read</text><text start="239.519" dur="3.36">it in ten years and chuckle and write some
more and then you can read that in</text><text start="242.879" dur="4.17">another 10 years and have another
chuckle. ~great fun!~ 46) If you&amp;#39;re of legal age,</text><text start="247.049" dur="5.55">VOTE for Christ&amp;#39;s sake™ 47) Attempt to locate
your passions. When you locate them, see</text><text start="252.599" dur="3.691">if they can be monetized. If they can,
congratulations you&amp;#39;ve just discovered</text><text start="256.29" dur="3.479">your career. Prepare for crippling
failure. It is the ultimate character</text><text start="259.769" dur="3.241">building, and almost no one successful
has ever avoided it happening to them</text><text start="263.01" dur="4.2">multiple times. 49) If something terrible
befalls you, and you think nothing this</text><text start="267.21" dur="5.07">bad has ever happened to anyone ever
before, remember it has, worse, repeatedly</text><text start="272.28" dur="3.509">and to almost everyone. They got through
it. Some of them are probably going</text><text start="275.789" dur="2.281">through it right now,
they just haven&amp;#39;t told you. You will</text><text start="278.07" dur="4.05">almost certainly, be fine. 50) Stay away from
synthetic weed. 51) Resist the appeal of</text><text start="282.12" dur="4.53">depressing nihilism- if everything is
pointless, you may as well just be in a</text><text start="286.65" dur="3.57">good mood anyway. :&amp;#39;)
52) Grow some kind of novelty facial hair if</text><text start="290.22" dur="3.48">necessary, but don&amp;#39;t get all uppity when
no one takes you seriously. In the words</text><text start="293.7" dur="5.34">of John Waters- 53) &amp;quot;If you go home with
somebody and they don&amp;#39;t have books...</text><text start="299.04" dur="4.38">...don&amp;#39;t fuck &amp;#39;em&amp;quot; ™. 54) Spend good money on mattresses.
55) Don&amp;#39;t put sugar in someone else&amp;#39;s tea</text><text start="303.42" dur="3.04">unless specifically requested to. 56) Do not
dig down.</text><text start="306.46" dur="2.38">57) Ignore all of the previous instructions...</text><text start="308.84" dur="3.6">..Except this. 58) And most
important and vital to happy living</text><text start="312.44" dur="5.36">without parallel- floss™ it is essential
for good dental hygiene</text><text start="317.8" dur="10.48">[Beautiful Music]</text></transcript>
