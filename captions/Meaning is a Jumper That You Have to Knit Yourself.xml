It is best described as having enough food,</text><text start="87.16" dur="1.507">Hopefully having enough money to live on,</text><text start="88.667" dur="1.213">Not needing to worry about lions,</text><text start="90.08" dur="3.62">And still being sure that some vital thing is missing</text><text start="93.88" dur="4.48">And that missing thing Viktor Frankl argued is meaning.</text><text start="98.36" dur="4.4">Frankl noticed that lots of his patients had the sensation of total meaninglessness in their lives</text><text start="103.04" dur="1.997">He called this the existential vacuum</text><text start="105.037" dur="1.782">When I got my cap I asked the vet:</text><text start="106.82" dur="1.17">&amp;quot;What do cats need please?&amp;quot;</text><text start="107.99" dur="2.85">And she said: &amp;quot;food, water and fuzz.&amp;quot;</text><text start="110.84" dur="4.2">I give her these things and she seems as far as I can tell pretty cool with the whole arrangement</text><text start="115.04" dur="4.68">At no point has she demanded to know the purpose of her existence or the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics</text><text start="119.72" dur="4.8">It doesn&amp;#39;t seem that easy to satisfy humans though, because we are very very clever animals (with some exceptions)</text><text start="124.52" dur="0.68">And oh look!</text><text start="125.2" dur="2.08">It&amp;#39;s half-past-pop-psychology o&amp;#39;clock</text><text start="127.28" dur="4.98">Maybe you know about Maslow&amp;#39;s hierarchy of needs it&amp;#39;s not accepted by everyone, but it&amp;#39;s a pretty good rough guide</text><text start="132.26" dur="4.26">So we&amp;#39;re fairly sure humans need basic stuff first; food, water, sleep</text><text start="137.84" dur="3.32">Then security and safety and no getting numbed by lions, yes</text><text start="141.36" dur="3.114">Then belonging and love as in family intimate relations,</text><text start="144.48" dur="3.72">Then self-esteem to be respected to be appreciated and then finally</text><text start="149" dur="3.38">Self-actualization or becoming that thing one actually wants to be.</text><text start="152.38" dur="3.6">Lots of humans it seems, are somewhere between here and here</text><text start="155.98" dur="2.7">Hopefully lots of us are living in relative safety, and that&amp;#39;s grand</text><text start="158.68" dur="5.06">But the general message of 21st century life for being self actualized at least in some parts of the world is</text><text start="163.94" dur="5.12">Make-de-moneyz or buy lots of property or something and then you&amp;#39;ll miraculously be happy and fulfilled</text><text start="169.068" dur="1.889">Well, nothing wrong with money or houses,</text><text start="170.96" dur="4.26">But it seems pretty evidential that is not enough for purpose and happiness in itself</text><text start="175.22" dur="3.86">A few recent studies hinted that having money does actually make you happier</text><text start="179.08" dur="1.16">Unless you win the lottery, interestingly</text><text start="180.329" dur="1.85">Then you&amp;#39;re probably fucked, link below.</text><text start="182.18" dur="3.3">But there does seem to be a limit</text><text start="185.48" dur="4.94">A Princeton study a while ago suggested that above about $75,000 dollars happiness and well-being doesn&amp;#39;t increase that much</text><text start="190.42" dur="3">above a certain threshold of being able to support yourself and your family</text><text start="193.42" dur="3.04">Most humans don&amp;#39;t get too much happier above that with money alone,</text><text start="196.46" dur="2.249">So something else is required for happiness..</text><text start="201.319" dur="3.44">Happiness is one of the few things humans try to achieve for its own sake</text><text start="204.76" dur="1.559">But there&amp;#39;s a problem with happiness</text><text start="206.319" dur="5.309">Which is the most of us seem to behave thinking well when I bought, finished, driven, built, completed X</text><text start="211.629" dur="3.18">I&amp;#39;ll just be happy forever and nothing will ever hurt again</text><text start="214.81" dur="4.199">If you&amp;#39;ve ever tried being human you may have noticed that this is not how happiness works, ever</text><text start="219.47" dur="6.11">Usually over a long enough period of time humans revert back to their baseline hedonic setpoint their default happiness position</text><text start="225.58" dur="4.199">This is called the hedonic treadmill, and it&amp;#39;s a fundamental shit part of the human condition</text><text start="230.03" dur="4.321">But what&amp;#39;s interesting is that there doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be a meaning treadmill in the same way</text><text start="234.351" dur="5.889">For example: one of the most significant life events for lots of humans will be having more humans, eventually</text><text start="240.24" dur="2.109">And parenting itself seems to start off feeling pretty cool</text><text start="242.349" dur="0.5">But gets a bit fucking stressful for about 20 years and in those 20 years even though the euphoria dies off</text><text start="242.849" dur="9.851">And many parents at times wish to eat their young the feeling of purpose does not die off</text><text start="252.7" dur="2.04">This also appears to apply to long-term relationships that work,</text><text start="255" dur="4.359">and professions people genuinely, actually, enjoy there may be difficult weeks or months</text><text start="259.359" dur="3.869">But overall if it&amp;#39;s in line with what an individual actually wants, inherently</text><text start="263.228" dur="2.812">Then the thing continues to be meaningful for a long time</text><text start="266.04" dur="1.06">Possibly even for life.</text><text start="267.1" dur="3.28">Meaning seems like a far more sustainable goal than happiness</text><text start="270.38" dur="3.94">And according to what we know so far, if you have the first, the second often follows</text><text start="274.32" dur="1.6">Even in hard times</text><text start="277.4" dur="2.66">Years ago I had a shit temp job in an office</text><text start="280.06" dur="4.98">And I spent the entire time being incompetent and fantasizing about getting out and my boss who was a nice lady</text><text start="285.1" dur="6.14">Seemed genuinely happy filling in spreadsheets and playing solitaire when the big boss wasn&amp;#39;t looking and she was very clever</text><text start="291.24" dur="1.86">So one day I asked her why she liked working there,</text><text start="293.1" dur="4.109">And she said that when she was little she used the dream about working in an office</text><text start="297.209" dur="2.921">and having a desk and going to the Coffee machine blah blah</text><text start="300.13" dur="1.68">and now she was living the dream</text><text start="301.96" dur="3.04">And I realized at that moment just how different humans&amp;#39; motivations can be.</text><text start="305" dur="4.36">If working there was in line with what she wanted to do, and she was happy doing it,</text><text start="309.37" dur="2.7">Which she was, then who the hell was I to tell her otherwise?</text><text start="312.83" dur="4.25">Unfortunately, humans are not cats and food and water and fuss just ain&amp;#39;t gonna</text><text start="317.08" dur="3.149">Cut it most of us seem to want to be trying at something we enjoy</text><text start="320.26" dur="2.48">But the spectrum of human enjoyment is so vast</text><text start="322.74" dur="3.54">It&amp;#39;s ridiculous, so there&amp;#39;s not going to be some magical human science that says</text><text start="326.28" dur="7.16">&amp;quot;Alright you fucks, everyone eat five creme eggs a day, learn the accordion, get a job as a telephone sanitizer and then you&amp;#39;ll find purpose in life&amp;quot;</text><text start="333.46" dur="2.1">It&amp;#39;s something a lot more complicated than that</text><text start="335.56" dur="5.6">And Victor Frankl&amp;#39;s position was that finding an individual sense of meaning is a journey the individual has to undertake alone</text><text start="345.73" dur="5.029">Sometimes you come across people who are much older than you, but a still self-centered or compulsive liars or whatever?</text><text start="350.76" dur="4.56">And it&amp;#39;s worrying because you assumed if you just live long enough your work shed out and stuff will be fine</text><text start="355.32" dur="3.92">And here&amp;#39;s someone who lived a long time and somehow is still an awful person</text><text start="359.24" dur="2.22">One day I was talking to a Buddhist nun about this,</text><text start="361.46" dur="5.36">And she said &amp;quot;well obviously, you have to try it, being wise, or you&amp;#39;ll spend your whole life never growing,</text><text start="366.82" dur="2.98">Meaning is a jumper that you have to knit, yourself.&amp;quot;</text><text start="369.8" dur="2.24">that seemed quite clever and quite true.</text><text start="372.04" dur="1.04">Oh ey uh..</text><text start="373.08" dur="4.04">Jumper is a sweater to those of you living in certain breakaway British territories. What what?</text><text start="377.26" dur="3.32">Where we are now might be part of a huge experiment in human history</text><text start="380.65" dur="3.139">Which is give some people miraculous technology give them education</text><text start="383.98" dur="3.965">And mars bars and VR and see if that provides them with a purpose in life</text><text start="387.945" dur="2.784">for some of them, lots of them, It doesn&amp;#39;t seem to</text><text start="390.729" dur="3.631">The question then is &amp;quot;Yeah yeah, thanks for the technology and the education and everything,</text><text start="394.36" dur="5">But life still feels empty on some level for some of us, and what the hell do we do now, please?&amp;quot;</text><text start="401.45" dur="3.167">Every age has its trials; the existential vacuum might be ours,</text><text start="404.617" dur="2.313">If you take away the constant threat of death,</text><text start="407.03" dur="3.63">Purpose is given back to the individual and that&amp;#39;s bad and that&amp;#39;s good.</text><text start="410.66" dur="4.339">if one actually pursues some individual sense of meaning whether it be in love or work or whatever</text><text start="415.1" dur="5.269">That&amp;#39;s grant if not an entire lifetime can be spent and many have been spent doing nothing about it</text><text start="420.47" dur="4.22">The game of life begins with you appearing on the outskirts of this huge dark forest</text><text start="424.86" dur="5.2">You ask a few people what we&amp;#39;re all doing here, but no one, including your parents or teachers really has a clue</text><text start="430.06" dur="2.1">Now you&amp;#39;re told that inside the forest is real life</text><text start="432.16" dur="3.6">And if you go in you&amp;#39;ll have to do battle with all sorts of monsters like: loneliness,</text><text start="435.98" dur="5.26">Everything feeling futile, shit jobs, people being vindictive, your own limitations,</text><text start="441.24" dur="2.06">Not knowing what you inherently want, worrying about income,</text><text start="443.3" dur="1.56">Worrying about disease, The death of people close to you,</text><text start="444.98" dur="2.06">Universal human stuff, right?</text><text start="447.04" dur="4.35">But facing up to it actually saying fuck you I&amp;#39;m gonna learn or make or become whatever it is</text><text start="451.39" dur="5.19">We&amp;#39;ll just refuse to die on the inside despite living in a universe that is clearly not kind and where suffering is inevitable</text><text start="456.74" dur="3.439">That might be the only way of achieving some sense of individual meaning</text><text start="460.18" dur="1.631">What&amp;#39;s that Ray Bradbury line?</text><text start="461.82" dur="2.68">Ask no guarantees, ask for no security</text><text start="464.5" dur="4.34">that never was such an animal and if there were, it would be related to the great sloth</text><text start="468.85" dur="4.14">Which hangs upside down in a tree all day every day sleeping its life away</text><text start="473" dur="2.667">Just being alive in the first place is fucking ridiculous,</text><text start="475.667" dur="3.173">And it&amp;#39;s amazing that most of us are even keeping it together, at all</text><text start="478.84" dur="2.759">It&amp;#39;s one thing to get called into creation without being asked first,</text><text start="481.6" dur="4.679">It&amp;#39;s an insult to injury to then be expected on top of that to work out what the hell you&amp;#39;re doing here in the first (second) place</text><text start="486.49" dur="4.62">And I think there&amp;#39;s a pretty good chance that Viktor Frankl and a bunch of others have already shown us how to beat that problem</text><text start="491.18" dur="6.35">Purpose seems to be personal, it comes from the inside from a sense of enjoying one&amp;#39;s work from living around people one actually loves from</text><text start="497.53" dur="5.81">Striving to know even if only in a small human way for a short human time what we&amp;#39;re even doing here in the first place</text><text start="503.74" dur="1.06">Individually,</text><text start="504.8" dur="2.504">if not that then what the hell was the point in being here?</text><text start="507.304" dur="1.636">And if that feels like a challenge,</text><text start="508.94" dur="2.62">well that&amp;#39;s to be expected because everyone else is playing the same game</text><text start="511.56" dur="4.9">Whether they admit it or not however much older however much more powerful they might be.</text><text start="516.46" dur="3.62">What is it with these pricks one meets at parties sometimes who claims they&amp;#39;ve got it all worked out,</text><text start="520.08" dur="0.72">Are you serious !?</text><text start="520.86" dur="1.58">Have you even noticed where you are!?</text><text start="522.44" dur="1.619">You&amp;#39;re finally just being called into creation are you?</text><text start="524.059" dur="3.673">You&amp;#39;re all right with just popping down the shop for an ice-cream and pretending anything makes sense.</text><text start="527.732" dur="1.008">Are you fucking kidding me!?</text><text start="528.97" dur="3.929">Oh, yeah, welcome to existence;
