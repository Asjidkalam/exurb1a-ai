dur="1.02">and you might have...</text><text start="3.74" dur="0.84">regrets.</text><text start="4.78" dur="1.62">You will wish you&amp;#39;d worked harder,</text><text start="6.4" dur="0.96">made more money,</text><text start="7.36" dur="1.38">spent less time with your family,</text><text start="8.74" dur="1.34">less time with your friends.</text><text start="10.08" dur="1.14">You will reminisce fondly</text><text start="11.22" dur="2.08">about all the evenings you stayed home alone,</text><text start="13.3" dur="1.42">so you could refresh Facebook</text><text start="14.72" dur="0.82">over</text><text start="15.54" dur="0.8">and over.</text><text start="16.52" dur="0.78">On your deathbed</text><text start="17.3" dur="1.88">you will be grateful for many things.</text><text start="19.18" dur="2.06">Thank God you stayed in that job you hated</text><text start="21.24" dur="1.68">for fear of rocking the boat.</text><text start="23.02" dur="2.6">Thank God you settle for friendships with total bellends</text><text start="25.62" dur="1.58">instead of making the effort to meet people</text><text start="27.2" dur="1.22">who were on your wavelength.</text><text start="28.42" dur="2.06">Thank God you ignored your dream career,</text><text start="30.48" dur="2.02">so you wouldn&amp;#39;t upset your family.</text><text start="32.5" dur="0.94">On your deathbed</text><text start="33.44" dur="2.2">you&amp;#39;ll be glad you didn&amp;#39;t tell these humans you loved</text><text start="35.64" dur="0.86">that you loved them</text><text start="36.5" dur="1.4">before they were gone forever.</text><text start="37.9" dur="1.5">You&amp;#39;ll be glad you spent years taking</text><text start="39.4" dur="1.6">passive-aggressive comments personally</text><text start="41" dur="2.78">from people who are probably just miserable dicks themselves.</text><text start="43.78" dur="0.72">You&amp;#39;ll be glad</text><text start="44.5" dur="0.96">that you were too cautious</text><text start="45.46" dur="2.32">to pursue your actual passions in life.</text><text start="47.78" dur="0.82">On your deathbed</text><text start="48.6" dur="1.14">you certainly won&amp;#39;t think back</text><text start="49.74" dur="1.78">on whatever it is you worried about constantly,</text><text start="51.52" dur="2.94">and laugh at how utterly insignificant it actually was compared</text><text start="54.46" dur="2.12">to what a fucking amazing time you could have been having</text><text start="56.58" dur="2.02">with a body that hadn&amp;#39;t started falling apart yet</text><text start="58.6" dur="1.56">in an age more enlightened</text><text start="60.16" dur="1.4">than any that have come before,</text><text start="61.56" dur="2.12">while the people you loved was still alive.</text><text start="63.68" dur="1.46">You were young back then,</text><text start="65.14" dur="2.64">and that was a resource more sought-after than antimatter,</text><text start="67.78" dur="1.42">more expensive than a hero</text><text start="69.2" dur="1.72">in Star Wars Battlefront 2.</text><text start="70.92" dur="1.16">Life was fleeting</text><text start="72.08" dur="2.04">and luckily you wasted the entire thing.</text><text start="74.12" dur="0.9">What&amp;#39;s that?</text><text start="75.02" dur="2.64">You only have an extremely limited period of time alive</text><text start="77.66" dur="0.62">well</text><text start="78.28" dur="1.4">better polish off another one then</text><text start="79.68" dur="2.76">to that German Dominatrix whose name you can neither pronounce</text><text start="82.44" dur="0.82">nor remember,</text><text start="83.26" dur="2.44">and then write a long list of things you do tomorrow,</text><text start="85.7" dur="2.34">which you will somehow find an excuse not to</text><text start="88.04" dur="1.88">for the four thousandth day running.</text><text start="90.12" dur="0.98">When you were young</text><text start="91.1" dur="1.38">you wanted a million things.</text><text start="92.48" dur="1.04">On your deathbed</text><text start="93.52" dur="1.22">you want only one</text><text start="94.74" dur="2.08">and that is to be young again</text><text start="96.82" dur="1.12">On your deathbed</text><text start="97.94" dur="2.26">you certainly won&amp;#39;t start having awful realizations,</text><text start="100.2" dur="1.56">like how the point of making money</text><text start="101.76" dur="1.22">probably wasn&amp;#39;t to make money,</text><text start="102.98" dur="2.66">but to do cool stuff with it for yourself and others.</text><text start="105.64" dur="1.64">That the point of a long life</text><text start="107.28" dur="2.5">probably wasn&amp;#39;t to put off your real plans until tomorrow,</text><text start="109.78" dur="2.38">but rather to give you more time to pursue them today.</text><text start="112.28" dur="1.88">Now literally fucking now</text><text start="114.16" dur="2.24">that the points are being a talking monkey in space</text><text start="116.4" dur="1.66">probably wasn&amp;#39;t to sit watching YouTube videos</text><text start="118.06" dur="1.8">by some pompous British knob end</text><text start="119.86" dur="2.44">but to have a good time with what little time there was</text><text start="122.3" dur="2.38">And to make other talking monkeys feel good, too.</text><text start="125.18" dur="1.32">You were born into an age</text><text start="126.5" dur="2">science fiction couldn&amp;#39;t even imagine.</text><text start="128.5" dur="3.1">When your species had access to clean drinking water through magic pipes,</text><text start="131.6" dur="2.34">to practically infinite information through magic wires,</text><text start="133.94" dur="1.5">to devices that can materialize</text><text start="135.44" dur="2.84">pizza in magic boxes at your door within 1 hour...</text><text start="138.28" dur="0.76">or less.</text><text start="139.04" dur="3.1">Despite being surrounded by miracles on a daily basis,</text><text start="142.14" dur="2.06">despite being matter that has woken up,</text><text start="144.2" dur="1.6">despite the entire universe</text><text start="145.8" dur="1.52">contriving to create you,</text><text start="147.32" dur="3.02">you still convinced yourself that the odds were stacked against you,</text><text start="150.34" dur="0.82">somehow.</text><text start="151.16" dur="1.62">That all the good ideas have been had,</text><text start="152.78" dur="0.84">apparently,</text><text start="153.62" dur="1.38">and that everything is shit</text><text start="155" dur="1">for some reason.</text><text start="156" dur="0.62">So...</text><text start="156.62" dur="0.64">great.</text><text start="157.84" dur="1.8">However you saw it at the time,</text><text start="159.64" dur="1.52">the future was a branching network</text><text start="161.16" dur="1.8">of opportunities and adventure.</text><text start="162.96" dur="4.26">At any moment you could have begun the project of refashioning your life into what you actually</text><text start="167.22" dur="1.12">wanted it to look like.</text><text start="168.34" dur="0.96">There would be risks,</text><text start="169.3" dur="1.3">there would be bad days,</text><text start="170.6" dur="1.14">there would be stress,</text><text start="171.74" dur="0.86">but that was nothing</text><text start="172.6" dur="4">compared to the misery of realizing the entire lifetime had been wasted on doubts and</text><text start="176.6" dur="0.98">self-sabotage.</text><text start="177.94" dur="1.66">The hard road was easy.</text><text start="179.6" dur="1.62">The easy road was hard.</text><text start="181.5" dur="1.92">It took 14 billion years to make you</text><text start="183.42" dur="1.74">and only 90 to fuck it up.</text><text start="185.16" dur="2.86">And with self-doubt and apathy you did fuck it up.</text><text start="188.12" dur="2">But that is irrelevant now,</text><text start="190.12" dur="0.96">at the end</text><text start="191.08" dur="1.3">all things considered,</text><text start="192.38" dur="1.22">all beds made</text><text start="193.6" dur="2.64">or I&amp;#39;s dotted and T&amp;#39;s crossed</text><text start="197.36" dur="1.28">because...</text><text start="199.96" dur="1.6">On your deathbed</text><text start="201.56" dur="1.82">you will think back on your life,</text><text start="203.38" dur="1.36">and you may have regrets.</text><text start="204.74" dur="1.54">You will wish you&amp;#39;d worked harder,</text><text start="206.28" dur="0.96">made more money,</text><text start="207.24" dur="1.82">spent less time with your family,</text><text start="209.06" dur="1.48">less time with your friends.</text><text start="210.54" dur="3.14">And maybe even closed this tab on your browser</text><text start="213.68" dur="3.5">and began taking steps towards going off to your actual passions.</text><text start="217.18" dur="0.72">Back</text><text start="217.9" dur="2.46">when you still had your entire life ahead of you...</text><text start="220.36" dur="1.08">And really</text><text start="221.44" dur="1.34">only yourself...</text><text start="222.78" dur="0.96">In your way.</text><text start="227.7" dur="2.44">Hey, I hope you like books about the future</text><text start="230.14" dur="1.68">and physics and AI</text><text start="231.82" dur="1.94">because I just put one up online...</text><text start="233.76" dur="1.46">The first section anyway.</text><text start="235.22" dur="1.48">It&amp;#39;s set partly in the present,</text><text start="236.7" dur="1.66">partly ten thousand years from now.</text><text start="238.36" dur="2.1">It has cats and squares and</text><text start="240.46" dur="2.62">cats and it&amp;#39;s nothing like my other stuff.</text><text start="243.08" dur="1.52">There&amp;#39;s also lots of sciencing,</text><text start="244.6" dur="0.78">mmm</text><text start="245.38" dur="0.86">your favorite.</text><text start="246.24" dur="1.76">Link below if you are interested,</text><text start="248" dur="1.76">link below if you&amp;#39;re not interested,</text><text start="249.76" dur="1.8">link below if you are apathetic.</text><text start="251.56" dur="3.16">A massive thank you to everyone who supported the channel on patreon</text><text start="254.72" dur="1.62">I could not have written this without you,</text><text start="256.34" dur="1.44">and I am eternally grateful.</text><text start="257.78" dur="1.58">Thanks I hope you like it.</text><text start="259.36" dur="0.66">Goodbye</text><text start="260.02" dur="0.82">etc.</text><text start="260.84" dur="3.16">(And a massive thank you to you, too, Exurb1a, for giving us so many good videos and existential crisis.
