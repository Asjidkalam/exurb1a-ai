while eventually you get language, the printing</text><text start="6.21" dur="3.4">press, moon landings, instant mash potato,
and Debbie Does Dallas</text><text start="9.61" dur="2.81">This is thanks to a nifty piece of hardware
called brain.</text><text start="12.42" dur="3.219">It weighs about 5 percent of your body but
takes in 20 percent of your calories.</text><text start="15.639" dur="1.641">Anyway, there is a problem.</text><text start="17.28" dur="3.49">The software keeps getting updated every few
years thanks to culture, but the hardware</text><text start="20.77" dur="2.75">is exactly the same as it was back when we
were savages.</text><text start="23.52" dur="3.39">Upgrades to the human CPU take about a few
hundred thousand years even for small bug</text><text start="26.91" dur="2.82">fixes because evolution is very very slow.</text><text start="29.73" dur="4.39">But these restrictions might all be about to change in
our lifetime and here’s why.</text><text start="34.12" dur="1">Quick version:</text><text start="35.12" dur="1">This is Ray Kurzweil.</text><text start="36.12" dur="1">He&amp;#39;s a smart guy.</text><text start="37.12" dur="2.98">He&amp;#39;s invented lots of stuff you&amp;#39;ve probably
used yourself, and has written a bunch of books.</text><text start="40.1" dur="3.39">Now, he thinks human technology is getting
better exponentially.</text><text start="43.49" dur="3.35">That means it&amp;#39;s not getting better year by
year, it&amp;#39;s doubling at how much better it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="46.84" dur="1.31">getting as it goes on.</text><text start="48.15" dur="5.17">So, if it keeps up at this rate he thinks, this century, we&amp;#39;re
going to get to a thing called the singularity.</text><text start="53.32" dur="3.34">It&amp;#39;s a word borrowed from physics and it basically
means that there will be a point when technology</text><text start="56.66" dur="4.03">is improving so fast, you can&amp;#39;t even begin
to imagine what the near future will look</text><text start="60.69" dur="1">like.</text><text start="61.69" dur="1">Rational Minibreak:</text><text start="62.69" dur="2.67">Before we get deeper into this, let&amp;#39;s just
admit that if there&amp;#39;s one thing we&amp;#39;re worse</text><text start="65.36" dur="3.43">at than not murdering each other it&amp;#39;s predicting
the future.</text><text start="68.79" dur="3.38">If you told a victorian that in about 100
years we&amp;#39;d all have this communications thing</text><text start="72.17" dur="3.3">in our pockets that gives you access to all
human knowledge they might&amp;#39;ve said “Flaming</text><text start="75.47" dur="1.96">tallywags, tell what do you use it for?”</text><text start="77.43" dur="3.19">And if you&amp;#39;re going to answer honestly, you&amp;#39;ll
say porn and cats.</text><text start="80.62" dur="1.87">And quite a lot more porn than cats.</text><text start="82.49" dur="3.82">In other words, we always expect utopia is
coming and what we usually get is smarter</text><text start="86.31" dur="2.79">ways to do stupid stuff we&amp;#39;ve always been
doing.</text><text start="89.1" dur="4.51">Anyway, let&amp;#39;s imagine Ray Kurzweil is right
and the singularity has happened.</text><text start="93.61" dur="2.24">Technology is improving so quickly we can&amp;#39;t
keep up with it.</text><text start="95.85" dur="1.47">What does the world look like?</text><text start="97.32" dur="2.82">Well, maybe we can answer that with an acronym:
GRAIN.</text><text start="100.14" dur="4.93">This stands for genetics, robotics, AI, and
nanotechnology, and even if only one of these</text><text start="105.07" dur="2.89">really takes off, that might mean the end of humanity
as we know it.</text><text start="107.96" dur="3.58">So, for example if genetics gets pretty good,
we&amp;#39;re might start redesigning humans.</text><text start="111.54" dur="3.82">That means possibly removing stuff like mental
illness, designer babies or splitting into</text><text start="115.36" dur="2">thousands of different species of humans.</text><text start="117.36" dur="1.85">It may&amp;#39;ve already started.</text><text start="119.21" dur="3.36">There&amp;#39;s a very strange new technique called
Crispr which means we might soon starting</text><text start="122.57" dur="1.31">editing the genes of human embryos.</text><text start="123.88" dur="2.8">Please go and watch Kurzgesagt&amp;#39;s video  for a good explanation.</text><text start="126.68" dur="3.759">Or there’s robotics, which could revolutionise
agriculture, and again humans.</text><text start="130.439" dur="1">O</text><text start="131.439" dur="1">Hey there.</text><text start="132.439" dur="1">Having trouble lifting stuff?</text><text start="133.439" dur="2.351">Yeah, I am actually.</text><text start="135.79" dur="1.25">How about robot arms?</text><text start="137.04" dur="1">Pretty cool eh?</text><text start="138.04" dur="1">Yeah, amazing!</text><text start="139.04" dur="1">Thanks!</text><text start="140.04" dur="1">And those legs look a bit tired.</text><text start="141.04" dur="1">Need an upgrade?</text><text start="142.04" dur="1.69">Oh, yes please.</text><text start="143.73" dur="2.41">Abracadabra, robot legs.</text><text start="146.14" dur="1.819">Wow, that&amp;#39;s awesome!</text><text start="147.959" dur="2.221">And are you tired of those silly biological
genitals?</text><text start="150.18" dur="1">What?</text><text start="151.18" dur="1.6">No, I like my genitals.</text><text start="152.78" dur="1.2">Please don&amp;#39;t touch my genit</text><text start="153.98" dur="3.099">We can cut that little fella off in a second.</text><text start="157.079" dur="1.571">Hey presto, robot schlong</text><text start="158.65" dur="1.669">Aahhhhhhhhhhhhhh</text><text start="160.319" dur="3.021">Or artificial intelligence might get big,
but I think we all know how that one might</text><text start="163.34" dur="4.31">pan out if it goes tits up.</text><text start="167.65" dur="1.66">Or nanotechnology.</text><text start="169.31" dur="3.45">Nanobots are little microscopic robots that
hopefully will perform all sorts of complicated</text><text start="172.76" dur="1.849">tasks and make copies of themselves.</text><text start="174.609" dur="3.361">Just a quick doomsday scenario for you, say
you make two nanobots, obviously they make</text><text start="177.97" dur="4.18">four in no time, then eight, then sixteen,
thirty two, sixty four, one hundred twenty</text><text start="182.15" dur="3.479">eight, until you could convert the entire
planet into nanomachines by the end of the</text><text start="185.629" dur="1">week.</text><text start="186.629" dur="1.72">And possibly, like, the universe a bit later?</text><text start="188.349" dur="3.7">So GRAIN, that’s the acronym to remember
and it might mean the end of the world as</text><text start="192.049" dur="1.01">we know it.</text><text start="193.059" dur="2.89">Some of these technologies are coming and
we’re going to put them in our bodies.</text><text start="195.949" dur="4.37">And if that happens to a large extent, are
we human?</text><text start="200.319" dur="1">Or are we dancer</text><text start="201.319" dur="1.621">This the neocortex cortex.</text><text start="202.94" dur="3.059">It seems to be the main part of the brain
that separates us from the rest of the mammals</text><text start="205.999" dur="3.7">as we have such a large one and it allows us
to reason in an abstract way.</text><text start="209.699" dur="3.79">Some people think what we’re doing with
our technology is kind of building another neocortex</text><text start="213.489" dur="1.51">but made of silicon.</text><text start="214.999" dur="2.58">We&amp;#39;ve already started outsourcing our brains
to our technology.</text><text start="217.579" dur="4.44">When and IFFFF devices start being implanted
inside the brain, it isn&amp;#39;t technology anymore,</text><text start="222.019" dur="2.95">it might be the next step in the evolution
of life itself.</text><text start="224.969" dur="3.41">And the humans using that technology won&amp;#39;t
be humans anymore in the traditional sense.</text><text start="228.379" dur="3.29">We will have started on our journey up the
intelligence ladder to the next step in our</text><text start="231.669" dur="1">development.</text><text start="232.669" dur="7.78">Or nothing might happen and the future will be incredibly boring. But that seems unlikely. All right, real talk for a minute.</text><text start="240.449" dur="2.781">We&amp;#39;re probably mostly wrong about what the
future will look like.</text><text start="243.23" dur="1">We usually are.</text><text start="244.23" dur="3.789">But if only 5% of this stuff happens , IF,
it will be bigger than the printing press,</text><text start="248.019" dur="4.03">than the internet, bigger than fire even. And
it might mean extinction or the birth of a</text><text start="252.049" dur="4.461">new species of human but one thing is for
sure. If it happens, we&amp;#39;ll get to see the</text><text start="256.51" dur="1.65">beginning of it at least.</text><text start="258.16" dur="2.68">We might already be watching it without realising.</text><text start="260.84" dur="2.86">There&amp;#39;s no telling what we&amp;#39;re going to turn
ourselves into but there&amp;#39;s every reason to</text><text start="263.7" dur="2.02">think it&amp;#39;s part of a natural process.</text><text start="265.72" dur="3.02">Just because it&amp;#39;s technology that we&amp;#39;re going
to use to evolve this time, doesn&amp;#39;t mean it</text><text start="268.74" dur="1.91">wasn&amp;#39;t always going to happen.</text><text start="270.65" dur="4.33">This might be how species develop in the universe,
first through biology, then through technology</text><text start="274.98" dur="2.1">and then something else entirely maybe.</text><text start="277.08" dur="3.67">The future we live in today was unimaginable
to our ancestors but at least we&amp;#39;re the same</text><text start="280.75" dur="1.33">species as them.</text><text start="282.08" dur="3.711">Tomorrow&amp;#39;s humans might be not be the same
species, and stranger than that, they might</text><text start="285.791" dur="4.109">look back on our situation with the same regard
we give to primates or even single celled life.</text><text start="289.9" dur="7.41">life. Genetics, robotics, AI, and nanotechnology and whatever else we invent, might rewrite the rules of biology.</text><text start="297.31" dur="4.03">Every step we&amp;#39;ve taken has been on the outside
so far, exploring our planet, exploring the</text><text start="301.34" dur="1">universe.</text><text start="302.34" dur="1.31">It’s different this time.</text><text start="303.65" dur="2.32">This might be the first adventure that goes
inwards instead.</text><text start="305.97" dur="3.15">But we have a lot of bosses to beat before
we can get to the next level.</text><text start="309.12" dur="5">We’ve got doomsday weapons, deadly contagions,
possible climate catastrophe, political tensions</text><text start="314.12" dur="1.58">and god knows what else.</text><text start="315.7" dur="2.8">But if we make it through all that, if we
turn into whatever new species we&amp;#39;re going</text><text start="318.5" dur="3.04">to become, it&amp;#39;s probably going to be incredible.</text><text start="321.54" dur="3.56">Our descendants might one day look back on this
century and think how amazing it was that</text><text start="325.1" dur="4.64">considering how violent and stupid we were
sometimes, that we managed to do so much with so</text><text start="329.74" dur="4.07">little, and that in spite of all the odds
against us, we survived anyway and turned</text><text start="333.81" dur="10.39">into something better and wiser, whatever
that happens out to be.</text></transcript>
