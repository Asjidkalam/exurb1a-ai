It&amp;#39;s their job to bend over backwards</text><text start="53.52" dur="2.34">to accommodate your belief that you know more than they do,</text><text start="55.86" dur="2.48">despite them having studied their entire lives for this job.</text><text start="58.34" dur="1.22">&amp;quot;Yes,&amp;quot; they all say,</text><text start="59.56" dur="3.4">&amp;quot;Please tell me more about your groundbreaking idea for perpetual free energy.</text><text start="62.96" dur="3.88">As a physics professor, the concept is completely new to me and I&amp;#39;m sure a delinquent,</text><text start="66.84" dur="3.72">and frankly dubious smelling 18 year old is about to disprove the entire history</text><text start="70.56" dur="1.64">of fucking thermodynamics.&amp;quot;</text><text start="72.34" dur="5.54">Lectures will consist of many students all sleeping at once, in a large room, with a clever person talking at the front.</text><text start="78.04" dur="4.8">Seminars will consist of much the same, but with only a few students sleeping as it&amp;#39;s harder to get away with it.</text><text start="82.9" dur="3.02">If you are startled awake by the professor, and the sentence ends in an,</text><text start="85.92" dur="0.5">eh?</text><text start="86.56" dur="1.88">You have probably just been asked a question.</text><text start="88.44" dur="0.86">Do not panic.</text><text start="89.3" dur="5.8">If it&amp;#39;s an English lit or a philosophy seminar you&amp;#39;re in, answer that frankly you found the text problematic and simplistic in places,</text><text start="95.1" dur="1.62">wait for the applause to subside,</text><text start="96.72" dur="1.38">then readjust your beret.</text><text start="98.1" dur="1.92">If it&amp;#39;s a maths or science subject,</text><text start="100.02" dur="1.84">try launching yourself out the window,</text><text start="101.86" dur="1.32">because you&amp;#39;re probably fucked.</text><text start="103.38" dur="4.14">You may find yourself sharing a prison block with Lovecraftian nightmare creatures,</text><text start="107.52" dur="2.46">who use body odor as a primal defense mechanism.</text><text start="109.98" dur="1.74">Welcome to Student Accommodation.</text><text start="111.72" dur="3.3">In the coming years, you&amp;#39;ll probably have the opportunity to move off campus.</text><text start="115.22" dur="5.04">Friends who you generally knew from eating lunch together, or partying, will suddenly occupy the room next door.</text><text start="120.4" dur="3.88">It will seem inconceivable, that someone so lovable only weeks before, is in fact,</text><text start="124.28" dur="1.74">such a consummate filth wizard.</text><text start="126.02" dur="4.66">No no, just like all the other objects in the house, plates are of course self-cleaning.</text><text start="130.68" dur="3.88">Please continue to stack them up in the sink, like some kind of elaborate circus performance.</text><text start="134.84" dur="1.6">Decency, what&amp;#39;s that?</text><text start="136.44" dur="3.54">I simply love &amp;#39;Rage Against the Machine&amp;#39; at 5:00 in the morning, top volume,</text><text start="139.98" dur="3.5">accompanied by the deafening, and discordant melodies of frantic shagging.</text><text start="143.48" dur="3.62">Most universities sport a number of recreational establishments nearby.</text><text start="147.1" dur="4.42">Many of the local discotheques will encourage standing epileptic fits to loud music,</text><text start="151.52" dur="2.18">and consumption of large quantities of alcohol.</text><text start="153.7" dur="3.72">If that doesn&amp;#39;t sound like your thing, the library is usually open 24 hours</text><text start="157.42" dur="2.5">and they&amp;#39;re happy for you to do acid in the archive room.</text><text start="159.92" dur="2.8">As long as you don&amp;#39;t tell them you&amp;#39;re doing acid in the archive room.</text><text start="162.72" dur="2.88">In your final year, you may be expected to write a thesis.</text><text start="165.6" dur="3.12">The first draft should be finished several months in advance of the deadline;</text><text start="168.72" dur="4.34">though it can be begun and completed the night before hand-in with access to strong enough methamphetamine.</text><text start="173.06" dur="5.52">If you&amp;#39;re doing university properly, you&amp;#39;ll probably go into it thinking you already clued up about 80% of your subject.</text><text start="178.58" dur="1.98">And you&amp;#39;re here to learn the remaining 20%.</text><text start="180.56" dur="3.76">By the middle year/years, you may realize you in fact know about 20%,</text><text start="184.32" dur="2.44">and you have a short time left to learn the remaining 80%.</text><text start="186.96" dur="3.8">And upon graduation, you&amp;#39;ll now understand that you understand almost nothing about your field,</text><text start="190.76" dur="3.78">and that there is an ocean of people more talented at and committed to it, than you.</text><text start="194.54" dur="1.42">So that&amp;#39;s nice and reassuring.</text><text start="196.3" dur="0.82">Look...</text><text start="197.12" dur="1.6">it&amp;#39;s got a special ribbon on it.</text><text start="199" dur="1.239">Paradoxically though,</text><text start="200.239" dur="2.801">graduating is perhaps the hardest part of being an undergraduate.</text><text start="203.04" dur="2.56">The world is quite different outside of university.</text><text start="205.6" dur="4.48">If you don&amp;#39;t do stuff on time, you still get angry emails, but you also might find yourself unemployed,</text><text start="210.08" dur="1.18">and possibly impoverished.</text><text start="211.26" dur="4.48">Members of the general public often grow unreasonably annoyed if they notice you vomiting on their garden.</text><text start="215.74" dur="1.3">And quite by surprise,</text><text start="217.04" dur="2.68">you will notice you are now expected to be and quote,</text><text start="219.72" dur="1.16">&amp;quot;Actual Person.&amp;quot;</text><text start="220.88" dur="3.14">Unfortunately, this is in fact, the real, education period.</text><text start="224.02" dur="2.52">You teach yourself, grade yourself, ultimately.</text><text start="226.54" dur="2.54">And the only tuition fee is exactly one lifetime.</text><text start="229.18" dur="3.04">Lectures begin when you wake up in the morning, and end when you go to sleep.</text><text start="232.22" dur="2.82">And what you&amp;#39;re supposed to be learning, is not at all obvious.</text><text start="235.16" dur="3.68">Everyone else is also a student at Existence University.</text><text start="238.84" dur="3.2">Some of them appear to be perpetually enrolled in a course called,</text><text start="242.04" dur="2.22">&amp;quot;How to be a Total Cock Like All the Time.&amp;quot;</text><text start="244.26" dur="2.3">Others are getting their Masters and PhD&amp;#39;s in</text><text start="246.56" dur="1.26">&amp;quot;Just Being a Good Human&amp;quot;</text><text start="247.82" dur="2.04">and I humbly suggest you hang out with them.</text><text start="249.86" dur="1.9">Deadlines will not be extended.</text><text start="251.76" dur="1.74">Plagiarism will not be tolerated.</text><text start="253.5" dur="2.42">The answers will not be found at the back of the book.</text><text start="256.1" dur="5.96">In any case, the years after university are mainly for cultivating those qualities that may have been missing from your days as a student,</text><text start="262.06" dur="0.72">namely,</text><text start="262.78" dur="0.88">self-respect,</text><text start="263.66" dur="0.98">personal hygiene,</text><text start="264.64" dur="1.26">basic social skills,</text><text start="265.9" dur="0.74">humility,</text><text start="266.64" dur="1.7">and a tolerable personality.</text><text start="268.34" dur="1.74">Or, if those don&amp;#39;t sound appealing,</text><text start="270.08" dur="1.54">why not make the most of that degree,</text><text start="271.62" dur="3.08">and catastrophically disappoint your parents by becoming a YouTuber.</text></transcript>
