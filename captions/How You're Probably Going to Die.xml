scared of flying you might think hey that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="49.67" dur="4.509">easy, I&amp;#39;ll just fly crappy airlines, and wait

launch, that sounds a lot better, but considering</text><text start="71.99" dur="4.019">you&amp;#39;ll need at least a master&amp;#39;s degree, practically
perfect health, and testicles made entirely</text><text start="76.009" dur="2.64">of steel, maybe that might be a bit of a challenge.</text><text start="78.649" dur="1">All right?</text><text start="79.649" dur="2.771">Bungee jumping – 1 in 100,000</text><text start="82.42" dur="1.089">Mountain climbing?</text><text start="83.509" dur="1.64">Mm, about 1 in 1700.</text><text start="85.149" dur="1.371">Yeah, but in Nepal?</text><text start="86.52" dur="1.18">how about 1 in 160.</text><text start="88.79" dur="2.859">Actually, if you get above 6000m it&amp;#39;s more
like 1 in 10.</text><text start="91.649" dur="1.9">Oh holla, now we&amp;#39;re talking.</text><text start="93.549" dur="1.291">But maybe you think that&amp;#39;s cheating.</text><text start="94.84" dur="2.269">Normal people don&amp;#39;t climb mountains.</text><text start="97.109" dur="1.171">How about travel instead?</text><text start="98.28" dur="3.17">About 1000 people are killed each year in

3000 people.</text><text start="116.579" dur="3.56">But still your best chance of dying is probably
just to....live?</text><text start="120.139" dur="1.94">Because we suck at it.</text><text start="122.079" dur="2.75">Last century about a hundred million people
were killed by tobacco.</text><text start="124.829" dur="5.32">Likewise, if you&amp;#39;re fat, pardon me, a person

boring . So, chin up, eh?</text><text start="150.66" dur="5.4">Actually, while we&amp;#39;re at it, what about the
odds of you just being born to begin with?</text><text start="156.06" dur="5.42">Well, according to Dr. Ali Binazir who did
the math on this one, pretty like low?</text><text start="161.48" dur="2.929">Assuming your parents socialised like
normal humans, The probability of them meeting</text><text start="164.409" dur="1.641">was about 1 in 20,000</text><text start="166.05" dur="2.44">The odds that they even have a kid, given
global trends?</text><text start="168.49" dur="1.19">About 1 in 2,000</text><text start="169.68" dur="3.44">Now assuming they did meet, and your mum thought
your dad wasn&amp;#39;t a jerk, and he managed to</text><text start="173.12" dur="3.64">ignore the fact that she considered the star
wars prequels better than the originals, and</text><text start="176.76" dur="3.369">they actually did the sexy times, the
odds that you would be born, of that sperm</text><text start="180.129" dur="3.911">hooking up with that egg – in particular
are about 1 in 400.</text><text start="184.04" dur="1">Quadrillion.</text><text start="185.04" dur="3.979">And that&amp;#39;s not even the half of it, because before
the egg, before your mum and dad met,</text><text start="189.019" dur="2.751">there is of course all of
your ancestors who also had to get laid, and</text><text start="191.77" dur="3.34">just taking that about 100,000 generations
back, we&amp;#39;re talking about 10 to the power</text><text start="195.11" dur="3.519">of 45,000 that they would all meet, but now
we have to calculate the odds of every single</text><text start="198.629" dur="3.121">one of those 100,000 meetings between your
ancestors would work out, and those sperms</text><text start="201.75" dur="6.37">and eggs would match up, well that comes out
at about 1 in ten to the power of 2,640,000</text><text start="208.12" dur="4.649">which is a number so big you can&amp;#39;t even, well
you know like a bag of m&amp;amp;ms?</text><text start="212.769" dur="2.611">Well, it&amp;#39;s a few trillion of those.</text><text start="215.38" dur="1.76">Timesed by all the particles in the universe.</text><text start="217.14" dur="3.18">Multipled by Jabba the hut&amp;#39;s waist measurement.</text><text start="220.32" dur="1.529">With a cherry on top.</text><text start="221.849" dur="1.801">It&amp;#39;s big all right.</text><text start="223.65" dur="3.449">All in all, flying is pretty safe, your death
is going to be boring, and your birth was</text><text start="227.099" dur="1.541">rarer than a fucking mewtwo</text><text start="228.64" dur="0.53">Au Revoir</text></transcript>
