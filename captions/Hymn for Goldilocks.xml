No-one knows it&amp;#39;s name,</text><text start="19.44" dur="4.18">where gravity was strong enough and did light the stars and planets came about and boy, they were gorgeous,</text><text start="23.62" dur="1.26">planets in perpetual winter,</text><text start="24.88" dur="1.34">planets in perpetual summer,</text><text start="26.22" dur="1.54">planets that could rival the Garden of Eden</text><text start="27.76" dur="1.04">and no bloody snakes!</text><text start="28.8" dur="2.6">And on one of them, eventually, complex life evolved</text><text start="31.4" dur="2">and one of the species developed large brains</text><text start="33.4" dur="2">and learned things like manners and dabing,</text><text start="35.4" dur="2.48">and they looked up at the stars and wondered what they were doing here.</text><text start="37.88" dur="2">You call them octopuses, I suppose.</text><text start="40.12" dur="1.76">Gosh, they were clever, (for octopuses),</text><text start="41.88" dur="2">And one of them, several million years in,</text><text start="43.88" dur="2.14">almost wrote something in ink on the sea floor,</text><text start="46.02" dur="1.52">a message to its friend.</text><text start="47.54" dur="1.36">And the message almost read;</text><text start="48.9" dur="1.6">&amp;quot;Hi! How are you?&amp;quot;</text><text start="50.5" dur="2.62">And a few millennia later, space folded back on itself and,</text><text start="53.12" dur="0.9">you get the idea.</text><text start="54.02" dur="1.1">Goodbye octopi.</text><text start="56.66" dur="2.4">There&amp;#39;s another universe where life formed on every planet</text><text start="59.06" dur="2">in every solar system, and it was carbon based,</text><text start="61.06" dur="0.98">it was silicone based</text><text start="62.04" dur="2.38">and it was made of crystals and water and plasma,</text><text start="64.42" dur="1.9">it was made of quantum fields and light,</text><text start="66.32" dur="2">and everything was alive, everything was doing a boogie,</text><text start="68.32" dur="2">and it was everybody&amp;#39;s birthday, everyday</text><text start="70.32" dur="0.7">(relatively)</text><text start="71.02" dur="1">and everyone got presents,</text><text start="72.02" dur="1.48">and they had over a trillion languages,</text><text start="73.5" dur="2.96">some written down, some only spoken, some conducted telepathically,</text><text start="76.46" dur="2">and they built a galactic civilisation together,</text><text start="78.46" dur="1.16">as a perfect unity,</text><text start="79.62" dur="3.26">sharing stories, sharing technology, speaking a common tongue,</text><text start="82.88" dur="2.56">understanding everything about how the cosmos had been put together.</text><text start="86.48" dur="1.8">And finally, when everything was sorted,</text><text start="88.28" dur="3.3">the galaxies were arranged into perfect geometric formations,</text><text start="91.58" dur="3.02">transmitting pure love, and wisdom, and birthday greetings</text><text start="94.6" dur="2.36">to all species in the universe, for all time.</text><text start="97.24" dur="1.38">Paper cuts never happened,</text><text start="98.62" dur="1.28">coke came in glass bottles,</text><text start="99.9" dur="2">no-one even remembered the word for war,</text><text start="101.9" dur="2.3">everything was beautiful, and nothing hurt.</text><text start="105.1" dur="2.42">And yet, for a quirk in their evolution,</text><text start="107.52" dur="3.32">because resources weren&amp;#39;t scarce enough on the planets these species developed on,</text><text start="110.84" dur="2.88">not a single creature in the universe was conscious.</text><text start="114.04" dur="2">Food was eaten, and no-one enjoyed it.</text><text start="116.04" dur="2.54">Movies were released, and there was no laughing, or crying.</text><text start="118.58" dur="2">No-one chuckled at a joke.</text><text start="120.58" dur="0.58">Ever.</text><text start="121.62" dur="2">Space collapsed back on itself, eventually,</text><text start="123.62" dur="2">and there hadn&amp;#39;t been a single moment of sentience</text><text start="125.62" dur="2">in the entire history of creation.</text><text start="128.94" dur="4.16">There&amp;#39;s another universe, where the strong force is too strong and the weak force is too weak</text><text start="133.1" dur="1.26">and nothing forms.</text><text start="134.36" dur="3.5">Another, where life develops too late and the stars have all gone beyond the light boundry</text><text start="137.86" dur="1.52">and there&amp;#39;s nothing to even see.</text><text start="139.38" dur="1.64">Another with too many dimensions.</text><text start="141.02" dur="1.06">Another with not enough.</text><text start="142.08" dur="2">Another where time goes in the opposite direction,</text><text start="144.08" dur="2.72">and species begin as gods, and wind backwards to cells,</text><text start="146.8" dur="1.46">and never learn to survive.</text><text start="148.26" dur="1.76">Another that only lasts milliseconds,</text><text start="150.02" dur="1.3">and collapses in on itself,</text><text start="151.32" dur="1.04">and heads straight back</text><text start="152.36" dur="0.86">to oblivion.</text><text start="153.92" dur="1.28">And that&amp;#39;s how it just might be,</text><text start="155.2" dur="1.6">across all possible universes,</text><text start="156.8" dur="1.64">across all possible spacetimes.</text><text start="158.44" dur="1.66">Problems with the laws of nature,</text><text start="160.1" dur="1.3">not enough resources,</text><text start="161.4" dur="1.58">missteps in evolution.</text><text start="162.98" dur="1.7">An atlas of dead-ends.</text><text start="170.66" dur="2">Then again, there is one exception.</text><text start="173.98" dur="1.84">There&amp;#39;s another universe,</text><text start="175.82" dur="0.78">a big one,</text><text start="176.6" dur="0.86">where life is rare,</text><text start="177.46" dur="1.94">where intelligent life is very rare indeed,</text><text start="179.4" dur="1.5">the stars are very distant from each other,</text><text start="180.9" dur="1.64">the laws of nature are very complex,</text><text start="182.54" dur="2">it&amp;#39;s extremely lonely for any species developing,</text><text start="184.54" dur="1.84">and most never even develop at all,</text><text start="186.38" dur="0.6">but somewhere,</text><text start="186.98" dur="0.84">we believe,</text><text start="187.82" dur="1.74">is a planet where the oceans are vast,</text><text start="189.56" dur="1.28">and the climate is varied.</text><text start="190.84" dur="4.96">Where the smartest species on the planet may have developed just the right mix of ambition and kindness.</text><text start="195.8" dur="1.32">And if you were to travel there,</text><text start="197.12" dur="2.66">to this unbelievably rare statistical anomaly,</text><text start="199.78" dur="1.6">to this impossibly lucky planet,</text><text start="201.38" dur="0.9">where evolution,</text><text start="202.28" dur="0.74">biology,</text><text start="203.02" dur="0.6">chemistry,</text><text start="203.62" dur="1.72">nae, the laws of physics themselves</text><text start="205.34" dur="2.16">have come together to create sentient intelligent life,</text><text start="207.5" dur="2.46">you may be able to catch the native inhabitants</text><text start="209.96" dur="0.88">singing for joy.</text><text start="210.84" dur="3.36">The one impossibly lucky, and rare position they find themselves in.</text><text start="214.2" dur="1.8">It is a chant of gratitude,</text><text start="216" dur="3.52">a ritual of showing appreciation for ending up in perhaps the one universe,</text><text start="219.52" dur="1.42">in the one solar system,</text><text start="220.94" dur="3.7">on the one planet with all the basic ingredients for intelligent, conscious life</text><text start="224.64" dur="2">it is a hymn for Goldilocks,</text><text start="226.64" dur="1.28">sung at all times of the day,</text><text start="227.92" dur="0.96">in every
