is called philosophy.</text><text start="6.74" dur="4.599">Most of the people there spend their time
writing papers, going to conferences, or ending</text><text start="11.339" dur="1">up as baristas.</text><text start="12.339" dur="1.74">That was a joke obviously.</text><text start="14.079" dur="2.06">No one in philosophy gets invited to conferences.</text><text start="16.139" dur="3.871">Now, if you head east across unemployable
mountain, you eventually get to Physics and</text><text start="20.01" dur="1.05">Math.</text><text start="21.06" dur="4.36">Now you probably want to visit these if you&amp;#39;re
interested in numbers, precision, and a lifetime of</text><text start="25.42" dur="1.48">sexual abstinence.</text><text start="26.9" dur="1.82">Both have their own neighbourhoods, of course.</text><text start="28.72" dur="3.46">I&amp;#39;d recommend the quantum district but just
be aware they&amp;#39;ve got a bit of a thing for</text><text start="32.18" dur="2.289">murdering cats, whatever that&amp;#39;s all about.</text><text start="34.469" dur="4.741">Maths has its own weird parts of town, P and
NP who are kind of at war at the moment.</text><text start="39.21" dur="6.469">There&amp;#39;s also Geometry Island which is basically
just lines.</text><text start="45.679" dur="2.421">Several hours dive away is astronomy, but
I&amp;#39;d give it a miss.</text><text start="48.1" dur="1.779">Bit of a black hole if you know what I mean.</text><text start="49.88" dur="3.089">Engineering is quite nice, but they haven&amp;#39;t
really contributed much recently though to</text><text start="52.969" dur="3.252">be honest, just.. bridges, dams, turbines.</text><text start="56.23" dur="2.04">Oh and planes obvously.</text><text start="58.27" dur="1.109">And rockets.</text><text start="59.379" dur="2.741">And space stations, petroleum,,
motors, telecommunications, electronics,,</text><text start="62.12" dur="2.02">and the industrial
revolution.</text><text start="64.16" dur="2.2">Let&amp;#39;s be honest, bunch of lazy pricks.</text><text start="67.36" dur="2.82">If you have a bit of extra time, just over
Humanities River is literature, take a walk</text><text start="70.18" dur="3.71">round the Russian neighbourhoods, their police
department is excellent, everyone&amp;#39;s obsessed</text><text start="73.89" dur="1.11">with Crime and Punishment.</text><text start="75" dur="3.5">The American district is all right too, the
weather&amp;#39;s pretty brutal during the day but</text><text start="78.5" dur="3.75">Tender is the Night, and the British section
isn&amp;#39;t bad but just don&amp;#39;t go in with any great</text><text start="82.25" dur="1.34">expectations, eh?</text><text start="83.59" dur="1.36">Just a few miles east is History.</text><text start="84.95" dur="2.99">Now they&amp;#39;re good people, but they do seem
to hang onto the past a bit.</text><text start="87.94" dur="2.4">Jesus just let it go guys, all right.</text><text start="90.34" dur="3.39">Linguistics is currently off limits at the
moment with an outbreak of irritable vowel</text><text start="93.73" dur="1">syndrome.</text><text start="94.73" dur="3.57">But West Chomsky is very nice, lovely gnomes.</text><text start="98.3" dur="2.66">A few miles away there&amp;#39;s the gender studies waterfall.</text><text start="100.96" dur="3.21">They&amp;#39;re usually quite pushy about everyone
checking their sunscreen.</text><text start="104.17" dur="1.08">And their privilege.</text><text start="105.25" dur="2.45">Just over Sarkeesian canyon we find education</text><text start="107.7" dur="3.59">I&amp;#39;d be very careful about visiting unless
you&amp;#39;re a fan of  incompetant idiot midgets.</text><text start="111.29" dur="2.56">I believe they&amp;#39;re commonly referred to as
children.</text><text start="113.85" dur="4.53">Psychology is an up and coming city, I&amp;#39;d recommend
the Odeipus Rex district which is full of</text><text start="118.38" dur="5.18">milfs, Skinner Island, but just be sure to
watch your behaviour, and the Milgram quarter,</text><text start="123.56" dur="2.13">but I&amp;#39;d avoid that one unless you want quite a
shock.</text><text start="125.69" dur="2.8">And then there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s sociology where everyone
is so advanced that that they&amp;#39;ve stopped believing in</text><text start="128.49" dur="2.64">stupid old fashioned
concepts like “proof”</text><text start="131.13" dur="1.86">Anthropology which is full of stalkers,</text><text start="132.99" dur="3.27">Theology, but Jesus Christ, those guys work
religiously,</text><text start="136.26" dur="1">Economics.</text><text start="137.26" dur="1.36">There&amp;#39;s supposedly treasure buried somewhere.</text><text start="138.62" dur="1">I don&amp;#39;t know.</text><text start="139.62" dur="1.21">I guess X Marx the spot</text><text start="140.83" dur="4.37">Medicine, where the local pastime is being
sued for trying to help people</text><text start="145.2" dur="3.5">Communication studies is a nice little break,
be sure to give it your full attention and have</text><text start="148.7" dur="1">a proper gander.</text><text start="149.7" dur="1">Law is lovely.</text><text start="151.7" dur="2.69">You can take a left at smallprint avenue,
a right onto litigation street, straight up</text><text start="154.39" dur="4.03">matrimonial highway and yeah, by the time
you reach the fountain you&amp;#39;ll find yourself</text><text start="158.42" dur="1.92">bankcrupt and paying for your ex&amp;#39;s lawyer.</text><text start="160.34" dur="3.96">Back over unemployable mountain, just past
film studies I&amp;#39;d advise finishing off your</text><text start="164.3" dur="3.48">trip with a visit to the Performing Arts,
where the inhabitants are lovely, by my god</text><text start="167.78" dur="1.76">do they make a song and dance of everything.</text><text start="169.54" dur="2.31">Now the geology of Academia is quite interesting.</text><text start="171.85" dur="1.77">There are undergraduates at the top,</text><text start="173.62" dur="4.16">Then a sub layer of postgrads who have been
severely crushed by geological pressure.</text><text start="177.78" dur="1">And life,</text><text start="178.78" dur="3.83">And finally the PHDs and staff who exist in
a constant state of stress and have been turned</text><text start="182.61" dur="1.32">into human magma.</text><text start="183.93" dur="3">You&amp;#39;ll know you&amp;#39;ve reached this level when
you notice something wet and soggy draining</text><text start="186.93" dur="1.98">out of your ear one day and realise it&amp;#39;s your
soul.</text><text start="188.91" dur="3.72">So if all that sounds up your street, why
not visit academia yourself?</text><text start="192.63" dur="3.77">I only came to avoid getting a real job and
I&amp;#39;ve been trapped here for 9 years.</text><text start="196.4" dur="1">Did I say trapped?</text><text start="197.4" dur="1.34">I meant, having a lovely time.</text><text start="198.74" dur="2.829">It&amp;#39;s like prison but the
sex isn&amp;#39;t as regular.</text></transcript>
