Everyone bangs on about the Empire Strikes Back being a superior Star Wars movie blah blah,</text><text start="119.219" dur="4.89">And that&amp;#39;s probably because it definitely is, but if we apply the old feelings, pictures, and ideas model to it,</text><text start="124.2" dur="2">I think it&amp;#39;s pretty clear why it was indeed amazing.</text><text start="126.3" dur="4.7">Well, there&amp;#39;s certainly feelings: Everyone&amp;#39;s in a pinch, everything shit, Darth Vader wants everyone dead.</text><text start="131" dur="4.6">There&amp;#39;s interesting pictures: There&amp;#39;s the pretty snowy bits, and a spacey bits, and the cloudy bits.</text><text start="135.6" dur="5">And there are lots of ideas: About loyalty, and sacrifice, and making out with members of your own family.</text><text start="140.7" dur="3.6">To be even simpler about this, stories just have to be about someone we understand,</text><text start="144.3" dur="2.7">Set somewhere vaguely interesting, and propose something,</text><text start="147.07" dur="3.43">Anything even remotely new that we haven&amp;#39;t thought about too much before.</text><text start="150.5" dur="3.3">They are also required to make sense. The main character can then be a robot,</text><text start="153.8" dur="3.2">or a drug-addled horse or a personified teddy bear...</text><text start="157" dur="1.7">Haha, what a story, Mark.</text><text start="158.7" dur="3.8">For more popular examples of feelings, pictures, and ideas done perfectly,</text><text start="162.51" dur="3.79">There is the &amp;quot;Blink&amp;quot; episode of &amp;quot;Doctor Who&amp;quot; with all the terrifying garden features,</text><text start="166.4" dur="3.4">The entire first season of &amp;quot;Mindhunter&amp;quot;, the Christmas episode of &amp;quot;Black Mirror&amp;quot;,</text><text start="169.8" dur="4.979">&amp;quot;The Great Gatsby&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Cloud Atlas&amp;quot; (The book, that is.), &amp;quot;Catch-22&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&amp;quot;,</text><text start="175.3" dur="2.63">Original fucking &amp;quot;Bioshock&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Wild Tales&amp;quot;.</text><text start="177.97" dur="5.13">That&amp;#39;s us, the storytelling ape. Sure we stopped pooping in the woods and huffing volcano vapor...</text><text start="183.1" dur="3.679">Well, maybe you did, but not too much has changed with human hardware, with the brain.</text><text start="186.78" dur="4.619">We still seem to be telling basically the same stories our ancestors enjoyed, and most of them center around</text><text start="191.71" dur="4.879">Romance, power and Chelsea robot people. Primal stuff... Right?... Yeah, okay.</text><text start="196.69" dur="5.41">Why? Because this is our condition, still, balancing between being animals and gods.</text><text start="202.1" dur="3.1">We care about base stuff, but we want a bit of clever extend, too.</text><text start="205.2" dur="3">We evolved in tribes, we love gossip and the feelies.</text><text start="208.3" dur="2.749">We evolved in nature, we liked scenery and context.</text><text start="211.05" dur="3.089">We also evolved the Lamborghini of brain areas, the Neocortex.</text><text start="214.209" dur="4.82">So we seem to be really into ideas like ethics, and politics, and putting watches up your bottom.</text><text start="219.06" dur="2.79">We&amp;#39;re designed to feel stuff, see stuff, and think stuff.</text><text start="222.07" dur="3.43">Stories seem to work when they mimic those basic needs, and more than that,</text><text start="225.5" dur="3.2">Telling stories is a fundamental human activity, I reckon.</text><text start="228.7" dur="3.95">And if you needed to kick up the arse to make your own stuff, I will attempt to provide it... now.</text><text start="234.12" dur="3.58">I doubt you know much about who your great-great-great grandparents were.</text><text start="237.7" dur="4.038">I certainly don&amp;#39;t know anything about mine, and truth be told it&amp;#39;s very unlikely that your</text><text start="241.959" dur="2.389">Great-great-great grandchildren will know much about you.</text><text start="244.48" dur="5.22">But one day our distant descendants will probably get curious about who we were and what we thought about the world,</text><text start="249.7" dur="1.9">And they&amp;#39;ll look back at the stories we&amp;#39;re telling now.</text><text start="251.6" dur="4.059">To our literature, and our movies, and our video games, and our TV, and everything else.</text><text start="255.669" dur="4.531">That&amp;#39;s how we build time capsules. Now to be clear, I&amp;#39;m not saying all our media is great,</text><text start="260.2" dur="2.4">But Hot Diggity we&amp;#39;re making some good stuff at the moment,</text><text start="262.6" dur="3.6">And Hot Diggity I&amp;#39;m sure lots of it will survive for a long time after we&amp;#39;re gone.</text><text start="266.2" dur="3.9">And the cool thing is that there&amp;#39;s really not much stopping any of us from making our own stuff,</text><text start="270.1" dur="2.84">In one form or another. Not necessarily to be immortalized,</text><text start="272.94" dur="4.44">But just to have set a true thing about where we are now, because the world won&amp;#39;t look like this forever,</text><text start="277.38" dur="2">And we won&amp;#39;t be here forever.</text><text start="280.3" dur="5.2">Humans are transient, stories are eternal, or as eternal as will be getting anytime soon.</text><text start="285.5" dur="2">It&amp;#39;s a little nod to future generations.</text><text start="287.5" dur="4.6">Hey, we were here. We felt stuff. We saw stuff. We thought stuff.</text><text start="292.1" dur="4.78">Love and kisses in the 21st century. And we also saw the first launch of the Falcon Heavy so fuck you.</text><text start="296.919" dur="4.04">It&amp;#39;s debatable whether cryogenics or mind uploading will take off in our lifetimes,</text><text start="300.96" dur="2.76">We&amp;#39;re probably not going to be the first immortal generation.</text><text start="303.72" dur="2.91">But if you can say a true thing about how we feel about the world right now,</text><text start="306.63" dur="4.37">And what it looks like and what we think about it, there is every chance that that will stick around.</text><text start="312.16" dur="1.74">Happy making things, mother lovers.</text><text start="314.6" dur="1.3">All the best.</text><text start="315.9" dur="0.8">Ciao.</text></transcript>
