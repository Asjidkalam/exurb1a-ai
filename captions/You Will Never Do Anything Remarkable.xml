</text><text start="178.54" dur="4.86">In 1983, Lieutenant Colonel Stanislav Petrov is monitoring the Soviet nuclear early warning system,</text><text start="183.4" dur="3.78">and notices that five nuclear missiles are apparently inbound from the US.</text><text start="187.18" dur="5.86">Petrov has a choice: he either picks up the phone and reports this to his superiors, and initiates probably a Russian response,</text><text start="193.04" dur="3.44">meaning nuclear war on potentially millions of casualties, or...</text><text start="196.48" dur="1.6">he... doesn&amp;#39;t.</text><text start="198.08" dur="5.2">He has a bit of a think: five missiles does seem a bit unlikely, considering the US at the time has thousands to play with.</text><text start="203.28" dur="2.2">As you may have guessed from the fact that we are still here,</text><text start="205.48" dur="3.06">Petrov did not report the strike, and decided the warning was a glitch –</text><text start="208.54" dur="3.58">which, indeed, it was, thanks to sunlight reflecting off of the clouds.</text><text start="212.12" dur="2.46">So, большое спасибо for that...</text><text start="214.58" dur="3.06">Or, this is Ignaz Semmelweis, who was to medicine</text><text start="217.64" dur="3.2">what the chief iceberg inspector must have been to the RMS Titanic.</text><text start="220.84" dur="2.84">Semmelweis was a doctor in the 1800s, and he noticed that –</text><text start="223.68" dur="1.7">now, I hope you&amp;#39;re sitting down for this –</text><text start="225.38" dur="3.66">washing your hands before delivering a baby actually stops women dying,</text><text start="229.04" dur="2.62">particularly from what was then called &amp;quot;childbed fever&amp;quot;.</text><text start="231.66" dur="3.2">Humans wouldn&amp;#39;t discover germ theory for a while yet, but it didn&amp;#39;t matter –</text><text start="234.86" dur="3.32">Semmelweis knew that something changed when doctors kept their hands clean,</text><text start="238.18" dur="2.16">so he informed the medical community of this,</text><text start="240.34" dur="2.42">and won loads of awards, and died happy and respected, and-</text><text start="242.76" dur="2.6"> </text><text start="245.36" dur="4.94">Semmelweis was ridiculed mercilessly by the medical community, despite having proof of his hygiene theory,</text><text start="250.3" dur="4.68">eventually had a breakdown, and died 14 days after being committed to a mental institution,</text><text start="254.98" dur="2.42">probably after being beaten up by the guards.</text><text start="257.4" dur="1.38">Stellar...</text><text start="259.42" dur="3.18">A century later, and this is Sergei Korolev.</text><text start="262.6" dur="4.72">In 1933, he designed the first liquid-fuel rocket to take off in the USSR.</text><text start="267.32" dur="3.98">He was rewarded for his efforts with imprisonment and a stay in the Gulag.</text><text start="271.3" dur="4.66">By some miracle he was released, and went on to mastermind the first satellites in space,</text><text start="275.96" dur="1.04">the first dog,</text><text start="277" dur="2.56">and, of course, the flight of Yuri Gagarin,</text><text start="279.56" dur="5.42">who on the 12th of April 1961 became the first of the Homo sapiens to leave the Earth,</text><text start="284.98" dur="3.12">orbiting our planet for 108 minutes in &amp;quot;Vostok 1&amp;quot;.</text><text start="288.1" dur="2.38">Sergei Korolev would die five years later,</text><text start="290.48" dur="2.9">probably thanks to injuries sustained in the Gulag.</text><text start="293.38" dur="4.9">The Soviet space program was extremely secretive, and he was largely unknown in his lifetime.</text><text start="298.28" dur="6.18">As history marches on, one day our period will blur into the countless others – behind and ahead.</text><text start="304.46" dur="3.2">We are not special, but some events will stand out.</text><text start="307.66" dur="1.56">This will stand out.</text><text start="309.22" dur="2.56">It was the first time we ever touched the heavens,</text><text start="311.78" dur="4.14">and it was in large part brought to us by a man grossly mistreated in his lifetime,</text><text start="315.92" dur="4.44">and largely still untalked of today, outside of science and engineering circles.</text><text start="320.36" dur="5.64">There is currently a portrait of him in the service module of the International Space Station above us right now.</text><text start="326" dur="4.52">And if, by some miracle, our species emerges from its current adolescence,</text><text start="330.52" dur="4.36">there is every chance Sergei Korolev&amp;#39;s portrait will one day accompany astronauts</text><text start="334.88" dur="3.08">to corners of the heavens Korolev couldn&amp;#39;t have imagined</text><text start="337.96" dur="3.02">even in his wildest dreams.</text><text start="374.16" dur="3.5">So, in light of all this, what makes a great person of history?</text><text start="377.66" dur="3.38">Well, let&amp;#39;s start with two &amp;quot;born to ideal parents&amp;quot; eggs –</text><text start="381.04" dur="1.32">yes, lovely;</text><text start="382.36" dur="2.76">two cups of &amp;quot;in the right place at the right time&amp;quot; sugar
