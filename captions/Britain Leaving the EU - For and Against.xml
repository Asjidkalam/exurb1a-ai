<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.12" dur="4.64">In just under a week there&amp;#39;s going to be a referendum on whether the UK stays in or leaves Europe.</text><text start="4.76" dur="2.3">Luckily the issue is pretty simple on both sides.</text><text start="7.08" dur="1.2">Oh wait. It isn&amp;#39;t.</text><text start="8.36" dur="5.12">It&amp;#39;s insanely complicated and it&amp;#39;s probably the most important decisionthat&amp;#39;s been made in a generation of British life.</text><text start="13.68" dur="4.88">It&amp;#39;s called the British exit - or Brexit, which sounds sort of like a quirky organic cereal.</text><text start="18.56" dur="3.74">So here&amp;#39;s a cheeky little overview of what&amp;#39;s been going on recently in &amp;quot;tea-ville&amp;quot;.</text><text start="22.3" dur="1.18">To get elected last year,</text><text start="23.56" dur="4.98">the British prime Minister David Cameron had to promise that he would let the British people decide if we stay in the EU or not.</text><text start="28.54" dur="2.96">Unfortunately for him, he now has to make good on that promise.</text><text start="31.5" dur="0.76">And here we are.</text><text start="32.26" dur="3.48">Depending on which way the vote goes, we either keep strumming our Uk-EU-leles</text><text start="35.74" dur="2.44">or use the Emergency Brexit and go our own way.</text><text start="38.18" dur="3.58">The problem is that the Brexit is an absolute gang bang of special interests.</text><text start="41.76" dur="4.44">Politicians are politicians and are getting donations from people with a vested interest in leaving or staying;</text><text start="46.2" dur="2">Business is business and wants to make money;</text><text start="48.2" dur="3.94">And then there&amp;#39;s us - the plebs - trying to make sense of this stuff and vote sensibly.</text><text start="52.14" dur="2">There are millions of arguments about what to do,</text><text start="54.14" dur="3.62">so we&amp;#39;re going to stick to the five most common ones on each side and go from there.</text><text start="57.76" dur="3.4">There are two camps: the Euroskeptics and the Euro supporters.</text><text start="61.16" dur="1.52">First then the Euroskeptics.</text><text start="62.68" dur="3">Here are some reasons why the Euroskeptics want to leave the EU.</text><text start="65.68" dur="1.48">1. Free movement</text><text start="67.16" dur="2">If you&amp;#39;re a member of a country in the European union,</text><text start="69.16" dur="2.96">you can work wherever you like and move around freely without a visa.</text><text start="72.12" dur="3.94">Euroskeptics are pretty annoyed about this and often argue that the UK is being flooded with immigrants</text><text start="76.06" dur="3.56">who are using welfare without justification or flooding the economy with cheap labour.</text><text start="79.62" dur="3.8">They argue that there are countries like Australia and Canada who already have tight border control.</text><text start="83.42" dur="1.62">So why can&amp;#39;t the UK do the same?</text><text start="85.04" dur="1.8">2. EU regulations.</text><text start="86.84" dur="2.68">Euroskeptics were also pretty worried about the EU parliament.</text><text start="89.52" dur="3.36">The EU parliament can now create laws that have to be obeyed in the UK</text><text start="92.88" dur="1.76">without going through the UK Parliament.</text><text start="94.64" dur="3.52">There are also a bunch of officials in the European parliament who aren&amp;#39;t actually elected.</text><text start="98.16" dur="3.3">Lots of people are worried this is the beginning of the end for UK sovereignty.</text><text start="101.46" dur="1.28">3. Integration</text><text start="102.74" dur="1.78">Lots of the EU already use the Euro</text><text start="104.52" dur="3.68">and it&amp;#39;s obviously moving towards becoming a kind of super country in its own right.</text><text start="108.2" dur="2.18">Euroskeptics obviously don&amp;#39;t want that to happen.</text><text start="110.38" dur="3.94">Europe is also talking about getting its own army, which some Brits are quite alarmed about.</text><text start="114.32" dur="1.8">4. Economic independence</text><text start="116.12" dur="4.46">Lots of people argue that the UK can stand on its own two feet and doesn&amp;#39;t need to trade inside the EU.</text><text start="120.58" dur="4.4">The commonwealth is still a thing and some economists argue that this could easily sustain us as well as other markets.</text><text start="124.98" dur="2.18">So why bother being part of the EU?</text><text start="127.16" dur="2">5. Euro Euro bills, y&amp;#39;all!</text><text start="129.16" dur="3.44">The EU pays somewhere around 12 billion a year to remain a member of the EU</text><text start="132.6" dur="4.44">which lots of people think is a bit steep considering we don&amp;#39;t even get a loyalty card or a free hat.</text><text start="137.04" dur="3.56">If we pull out we also won&amp;#39;t have to abide by European economic regulations,</text><text start="140.6" dur="1.94">we&amp;#39;ll be a completely separate economy from the EU</text><text start="142.54" dur="2.6">and there is an argument that we might prosper as a result of that.</text><text start="145.26" dur="2.18">In other words: Brits or GTFO.</text><text start="147.44" dur="1.5">For those reasons - and lots of others -</text><text start="148.96" dur="6.12">some brits think pulling out will hopefully restore former glory, tighter borders and greater Sovereignty to our Island nation.</text><text start="155.08" dur="4.52">However, as some of us may know too well already, pulling out isn&amp;#39;t always a reliable method.</text><text start="159.6" dur="2.64">And that&amp;#39;s where the other side comes in: the Pro-European argument.</text><text start="162.24" dur="2.26">Here are some arguments from Brits who want to stay in the EU:</text><text start="164.5" dur="1.36">1. Employment.</text><text start="165.86" dur="2.76">Around 3.5 million jobs might depend on being in the EU.</text><text start="168.62" dur="2.72">And if we leave, lots of manufacturers might just go abroad.</text><text start="171.44" dur="4.04">Also around 10% of the UK&amp;#39;s gross National value comes from the financial Sector,</text><text start="175.48" dur="2.62">despite the fact that is full of complete and utter bankers.</text><text start="178.1" dur="1.68">2. Research and funding</text><text start="179.78" dur="2.7">Plenty of top scientists in Britain come from elsewhere in Europe.</text><text start="182.48" dur="1.66">This might change in a big way if we leave.</text><text start="184.14" dur="5.5">Also the UK receives a fair bit of money from the EU for research funding and this could vanish and impact Academia.</text><text start="189.64" dur="1.34">3. Security</text><text start="190.98" dur="4.3">Yes, once we had an Empire, but these days we just sit around watching reruns of Fawlty Towers,</text><text start="195.28" dur="3.96">reminiscing about the good old days of &amp;quot;Oh, terribly sorry to bother you, is this your country?</text><text start="199.24" dur="2.24">Oh, good. Could we have it, please? No?</text><text start="201.48" dur="1">Yoink!</text><text start="202.48" dur="4">Global politics is changing. Certain leaders of very powerful nations...</text><text start="208.82" dur="1.2">...are getting a bit bossy.</text><text start="210.02" dur="2.88">And there&amp;#39;re also nuclear rogue states with itchy trigger fingers.</text><text start="213.24" dur="3.02">Some Brits argue pulling out is silly when we could be militarily stronger</text><text start="216.26" dur="3.22">for sticking it out with Germany and France and the rest of the EU.</text><text start="219.48" dur="2.44">4. Emigration, but from the other side.</text><text start="221.94" dur="2.8">For those Brits who live in other EU countries, they may have to go home</text><text start="224.74" dur="2.48">or at least get married pretty quickly if we leave the EU.</text><text start="227.22" dur="3.5">Also, if the economy goes tits up again, it means as a British citizen</text><text start="230.72" dur="3.62">you won&amp;#39;t just be able to swan off to some other country in the EU and start over.</text><text start="234.34" dur="2.22">5. Multinational corporations</text><text start="236.56" dur="4.62">Every year these corporations do something horrific and the EU generally steps in and finds their asses.</text><text start="241.18" dur="5.82">If the UK switches to single player mode, then there&amp;#39;s the possibility it could be pushed around a lot more by the likes of certain big financial players.</text><text start="247" dur="3.42">Anyway, that&amp;#39;s about 0.5% of all the arguments out there, but you get the idea.</text><text start="250.42" dur="3.28">Right now British television is a montage of people screaming at each other</text><text start="253.7" dur="2.4">and it&amp;#39;s almost impossible to take a definitive position.</text><text start="256.1" dur="4.62">The Euroskeptics argue that this might be the only chance we have to leave Europe and we need to seize it now.</text><text start="260.72" dur="3.44">The Pro-Europeans argue that leaving Europe could be a death blow to the economy</text><text start="264.16" dur="2.46">and to Britain in general that we never truly recover from.</text><text start="266.62" dur="2.18">And either position might be correct.</text><text start="268.8" dur="4">No one knows what&amp;#39;s going to happen next but whatever it is is going to be pretty Bloody historic.</text><text start="272.8" dur="1.8">So happy voting and no pressure!</text><text start="274.6" dur="3.48">It&amp;#39;s only the future of our entire country and our great-great grandchildren that we&amp;#39;re deciding.</text><text start="278.14" dur="0.68">Cheerio!</text></transcript>
