No don’t do that, just stay calm, you’ll</text><text start="12.849" dur="2.78">be fine.
What is that on the wings, sticky tape? British</text><text start="15.629" dur="3.301">Airways would never put sticky tape on the
wings. This is simply outrageous.</text><text start="18.93" dur="4.43">Maybe I can just get off, they can’t keep
me on here against my will and....Oh, no,</text><text start="23.36" dur="4.6">I’m definitely going to die.
Jesus Christ, no one is going to live if we</text><text start="27.96" dur="5.09">crash from this height.

Well I guess they weren’t vital to flying</text><text start="74.109" dur="2.85">the plane.
If you’re listening, Jesus, I appreciate</text><text start="76.959" dur="5.601">you’re probably quite angry about the...drugs
