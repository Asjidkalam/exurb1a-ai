<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.22" dur="2.56">To our excellent friends of Marble 3:</text><text start="2.78" dur="4.4">Congratulations on decoding this message from the cosmic microwave background radiation.</text><text start="7.18" dur="1.44">You must be getting very clever.</text><text start="8.62" dur="2.18">Don&amp;#39;t ask why it&amp;#39;s written in your languages –</text><text start="10.8" dur="1.06">give us some credit.</text><text start="11.86" dur="3.96">We&amp;#39;re gone now, but we&amp;#39;ve left this message behind for when you&amp;#39;re ready to hear it.</text><text start="15.82" dur="2.46">There are 6 more messages hidden here and there,</text><text start="18.28" dur="2.04">under things and over things in the universe,</text><text start="20.32" dur="3.52">and you&amp;#39;ll find them when you&amp;#39;re a little smarter and wiser than today.</text><text start="23.84" dur="2.92">None of the messages contain any recipes for technology.</text><text start="26.76" dur="3.42">This is just an invitation – to you and your descendants.</text><text start="30.18" dur="2.6">So, first, a little about ourselves.</text><text start="32.78" dur="3.14">We hail from a very distant place and a very distant time.</text><text start="35.92" dur="2.44">We do not have tentacles. Our skin is not green.</text><text start="38.36" dur="3">We have passed through the many stages of planetary ascendance,</text><text start="41.36" dur="2.04">and we&amp;#39;re off now, on our next adventure.</text><text start="43.4" dur="3.7">But before we go, there are a few things we would like to convey to you –</text><text start="47.1" dur="2.58">our excellent friends of Marble 3.</text><text start="50.46" dur="2.58">Hi, how&amp;#39;s it going? How&amp;#39;s the weather?</text><text start="53.04" dur="3.38">Presumably, you now have agriculture and civilization, yes?</text><text start="56.42" dur="3.1">How&amp;#39;s that working out? Is everybody well-fed?</text><text start="59.52" dur="1.3">If not, why not?</text><text start="60.82" dur="2.56">Are you held hostage to weapons you built yourself?</text><text start="63.38" dur="1.48">If so... Why?</text><text start="64.86" dur="5.48">Don&amp;#39;t feel so special. Biology differs from marble to marble, but the squabbles are always the same:</text><text start="70.34" dur="2.8">&amp;quot;Hey, give my toy back&amp;quot;.
&amp;quot;No!&amp;quot;
*Thump*</text><text start="73.14" dur="4.3">A very long time from now you&amp;#39;ll realize you had the materials to build heaven all along –</text><text start="77.44" dur="4.34">you just lacked the blueprint, and if we gave it to you now, you would only build hell.</text><text start="81.78" dur="0.96">You&amp;#39;ll work it out.</text><text start="82.74" dur="2.02">We predict you have simple spacecraft –</text><text start="84.76" dur="1.02">congratulations.</text><text start="85.78" dur="2.22">We predict you have simple doomsday weapons –</text><text start="88" dur="1">commiserations.</text><text start="89" dur="3.78">We predict you&amp;#39;re not yet clever enough to realize just how silly you are.</text><text start="92.78" dur="2.4">Such is it always with teenagers...</text><text start="95.18" dur="4.54">Perhaps you&amp;#39;ve had a good look around to the black, and noticed just how quiet it is out there.</text><text start="99.72" dur="2.84">You&amp;#39;re probably flirting with the idea you&amp;#39;re alone in space.</text><text start="102.56" dur="1.28">Don&amp;#39;t be so rash.</text><text start="103.84" dur="3.08">What does an insect on your marble know about your cities?</text><text start="106.92" dur="2.02">What do you think you know about the universe?</text><text start="108.94" dur="1.04">Baby steps.</text><text start="109.98" dur="3.14">And just as some insects climb great towers and look up,</text><text start="113.12" dur="3.92">recently you&amp;#39;ve discovered the true scale of things – or, let&amp;#39;s say, some of it.</text><text start="117.04" dur="4.32">Maybe you&amp;#39;ve wondered: &amp;quot;How is it possible the world is so big and so indifferent?&amp;quot;</text><text start="121.36" dur="2.8">It&amp;#39;s neither – but again, baby steps.</text><text start="124.16" dur="2.32">Feel free to grow into the galaxy when you&amp;#39;re ready.</text><text start="126.48" dur="2.36">We&amp;#39;ve left a few treats here and there along the way.</text><text start="128.84" dur="3.16">When you claim your thousandth sun – think back to your first,</text><text start="132" dur="2.12">and how you once believed it was alive.</text><text start="134.12" dur="2.12">Don&amp;#39;t be so sure some of the others aren&amp;#39;t.</text><text start="136.24" dur="4.46">And please, avoid living near the big red ones – it&amp;#39;s way more hassle than it&amp;#39;s worth.</text><text start="140.7" dur="2.78">Have you found the great black at the bottom of everything?</text><text start="143.48" dur="4.4">In return for the powers of adulthood, one surrenders the comforts of infancy.</text><text start="147.88" dur="3.12">Maybe that seems like a curse, but it&amp;#39;s a blessing, really.</text><text start="151" dur="1.84">You control your own destiny now.</text><text start="152.84" dur="1.78">You always did, anyway.</text><text start="154.62" dur="2.26">You will watch sunsets on distant worlds,</text><text start="156.88" dur="2.3">you will construct a few suns of your own.</text><text start="159.18" dur="2.14">You will learn to hear the music of the spheres,</text><text start="161.32" dur="2.04">and one day to play it yourself.</text><text start="163.36" dur="2.08">You will gain access to tremendous energies,</text><text start="165.44" dur="3.12">you will be denied access to some of your wildest scientific fantasies.</text><text start="168.56" dur="5.1">Nature&amp;#39;s imagination is better than yours, and she is under no obligation to make herself comprehensible.</text><text start="173.66" dur="4.38">As a rule, the great extinctions of other civilisations have not been due to cosmic events,</text><text start="178.04" dur="2.12">but the civilizations themselves.</text><text start="180.16" dur="4.36">You might only be a teenager, but many of your planetary cousins died much earlier still,</text><text start="184.52" dur="3.48">and many never even achieved your simple level of sophistication.</text><text start="188" dur="3.22">There are seven stages of planetary transition, as far as we know.</text><text start="191.22" dur="2.26">You are currently passing through stage 2.</text><text start="193.48" dur="2.12">Stage 2 is one of the most deadly.</text><text start="195.6" dur="4.04">You are waking up to your technological capabilities – transformative and destructive;</text><text start="199.64" dur="5.04">you have dared to position yourself as the smartest thing that ever was – and, naturally, that scares you.</text><text start="204.68" dur="3.92">As your development continues, you will discover deadlier and deadlier weapons.</text><text start="208.6" dur="3.48">You will attempt to fix the world, and break it horribly many times.</text><text start="212.08" dur="2.56">You will wander blindly into the universe&amp;#39;s libraries –</text><text start="214.64" dur="1.82">all hubris, all certainty –</text><text start="216.46" dur="4.38">and barely be out the door before you realize you didn&amp;#39;t understand a damn thing you read.</text><text start="220.84" dur="1.72">We were young once, too.</text><text start="222.56" dur="6.16">We ran about turning every rock over, and before we&amp;#39;d even seen what was underneath, we were already picking the rocks up and bashing each other with them.</text><text start="228.72" dur="4.02">But at some point we all sat down together to just admire the beach.</text><text start="232.74" dur="2.74">Every civilization is entirely unique.</text><text start="235.48" dur="2.04">You are the only marble with you on it.</text><text start="237.52" dur="3.58">And if you blow the whole thing to hell now, a thing like you will never happen again</text><text start="241.1" dur="1.66">for all of time and back.</text><text start="242.76" dur="3.86">If you succeed, you will do it alone, and one day you&amp;#39;ll be proud of that.</text><text start="246.62" dur="2.28">You&amp;#39;re going to have to explore the jungles map-less.</text><text start="248.9" dur="2.78">You&amp;#39;re gonna have to guard your own crib and wipe your own tears.</text><text start="251.68" dur="2.34">There are only a handful of ways to save the world.</text><text start="254.02" dur="2.06">There are a trillion ways to end it.</text><text start="256.08" dur="3.98">Our history is very different to yours, but our futures aren&amp;#39;t so dissimilar.</text><text start="260.06" dur="5.12">We can no more explain the true shape of things to you than you could explain algebra to one of your animal friends,</text><text start="265.18" dur="3.34">but just know that if everything goes well, a long time from now</text><text start="268.52" dur="4.26">you will stop at the top of the hill for lunch and look back down at how far you&amp;#39;ve come,</text><text start="272.78" dur="1.66">and it WILL have been worth it.</text><text start="274.44" dur="2">This has been an invitation.</text><text start="276.44" dur="2.58">We know you won&amp;#39;t make it to the party for a long time yet,</text><text start="279.02" dur="3.46">but when you do, it will be an honor to welcome you into the warm.</text><text start="282.48" dur="2.52">And the next adventure we&amp;#39;ll embark on together:</text><text start="285" dur="1.8">as friends, as equals,</text><text start="286.8" dur="2.16">as cousins with the universe in common,</text><text start="288.96" dur="1.72">bound for the open road.</text><text start="290.68" dur="2.68">Be proud: you&amp;#39;ve come such a long way.</text><text start="293.36" dur="3.04">Be careful: there is so much further to go.</text><text start="296.4" dur="3.76">Until we speak again, then – far from here, and long from now.</text><text start="300.16" dur="2.62">To our excellent friends of Marble 3.</text><text start="302.78" dur="4.56">With love, and admiration, and the best wishes on your long journey.</text><text start="307.34" dur="2.22">We&amp;#39;ll see you when you get here.</text></transcript>
