<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.56" dur="1.26">You meet at a party</text><text start="2.34" dur="2.28">You&amp;#39;re both young, probably late teens</text><text start="4.82" dur="1.04">You&amp;#39;ve both screwed other people</text><text start="5.86" dur="1.44">but it was all sort of, clumsy</text><text start="7.58" dur="2.2">You find excuses to hang out and pretend to be friends</text><text start="10.12" dur="3.2">She has a tiny birthmark on her neck that you notice but don&amp;#39;t mention</text><text start="13.5" dur="3.6">You catch yourself thinking about her a little, then a lot, then all the time</text><text start="17.1" dur="0.78">You stop sleeping,</text><text start="17.88" dur="0.6">and eating,</text><text start="18.48" dur="1.66">and whatever music you&amp;#39;re listening to at the time</text><text start="20.14" dur="0.88">will be so tied to her,</text><text start="21.02" dur="0.98">that in 20 years,</text><text start="22" dur="1.8">someone will play that song again and just for a second</text><text start="23.8" dur="1.8">you&amp;#39;ll remember exactly how you feel now</text><text start="25.78" dur="1.96">And at some point, probably involving alcohol,</text><text start="27.74" dur="1.5">you&amp;#39;re going to take your clothes off together,</text><text start="29.24" dur="0.94">and now you&amp;#39;re really fucked</text><text start="30.18" dur="1.14">because she&amp;#39;s under your skin</text><text start="31.54" dur="0.94">You had no idea,</text><text start="32.48" dur="1.64">you can care about another human this much</text><text start="34.24" dur="1.82">And nothing can ever ruin this</text><text start="36.06" dur="1.76">And anyone who tells you otherwise is an idiot</text><text start="37.96" dur="0.78">You&amp;#39;re not even 20 yet,</text><text start="38.74" dur="2.36">but you just met the love of your life; how lucky is that?</text><text start="41.1" dur="1.96">You&amp;#39;re probably neglecting time on your term papers,</text><text start="43.06" dur="1.78">not getting much sleep but that doesn&amp;#39;t matter</text><text start="44.96" dur="1.2">You get to know her parents well,</text><text start="46.16" dur="1.14">and she gets to know yours too</text><text start="47.3" dur="2.06">and you&amp;#39;ve tried every sexual position under the sun</text><text start="49.36" dur="1.38">And sex is kinda comforting now,</text><text start="50.74" dur="1.82">rather than something you think about doing all the time</text><text start="52.68" dur="0.9">You&amp;#39;ve got big plans</text><text start="53.58" dur="1.54">And nothing can ever ruin this</text><text start="55.26" dur="2.62">She shows you new music you probably wouldn&amp;#39;t have even given a shit about before</text><text start="57.88" dur="1.54">but somehow you quite like it now</text><text start="59.54" dur="2.84">You tell you about your shit and she pretends to care very convincingly</text><text start="62.44" dur="1.48">You move in together because,</text><text start="63.92" dur="0.5">why not?</text><text start="64.56" dur="0.72">You stay up late</text><text start="65.28" dur="0.74">You drink</text><text start="66.02" dur="0.82">You screw</text><text start="66.84" dur="1.76">You watch her sleeping in the morning sometimes</text><text start="68.6" dur="2.64">and suddenly all that bullshit love poetry they forced in you in school,</text><text start="71.24" dur="1.16">begins to make sense</text><text start="72.84" dur="2">You don&amp;#39;t believe in fate or crap like that</text><text start="74.84" dur="1.84">but you begin to understand why some people do</text><text start="76.8" dur="1.36">On one day she looks at someone else,</text><text start="78.16" dur="0.86">and smiles</text><text start="79.02" dur="0.6">or laughs</text><text start="79.62" dur="2.2">and you feel this sort of weird sting in your brain</text><text start="81.96" dur="0.98">Welcome to jealously</text><text start="82.94" dur="1.12">It&amp;#39;s quite natural</text><text start="84.18" dur="1.84">You don&amp;#39;t mention it because you&amp;#39;re not completely insane</text><text start="86.52" dur="1.52">She probably feels the same way about you,</text><text start="88.04" dur="0.9">and that&amp;#39;s nice</text><text start="89.3" dur="1.04">You both get jobs</text><text start="90.34" dur="0.96">You get stressed</text><text start="91.3" dur="0.86">You get tired</text><text start="92.16" dur="1.76">You watch a lot of TV together</text><text start="93.92" dur="2.08">You don&amp;#39;t screw so often now but what did you expect?</text><text start="96.18" dur="1.22">You talk about getting a dog</text><text start="97.4" dur="1.2">She mentions some guy at work</text><text start="98.6" dur="1.32">who&amp;#39;s been sending her funny emails</text><text start="99.92" dur="1.1">and you decide to murder him</text><text start="101.02" dur="1.64">but quickly remember that&amp;#39;s illegal</text><text start="102.8" dur="1.46">You start go running in the afternoons</text><text start="104.26" dur="2.6">and you notice this girl that&amp;#39;s usually this out around the same time</text><text start="106.92" dur="1.36">She&amp;#39;s kinda pretty but</text><text start="108.28" dur="0.54">whatever</text><text start="108.88" dur="1.82">You spend less time together in the evening</text><text start="110.7" dur="1.96">You&amp;#39;ve forgotten what butterflies feel like</text><text start="112.82" dur="2">You mention this to a guy you know who&amp;#39;s been married for years</text><text start="114.82" dur="1.3">and he tells you that&amp;#39;s what happens</text><text start="116.12" dur="1.34">You&amp;#39;ve can&amp;#39;t be loved out forever</text><text start="117.72" dur="0.88">This scares you a little</text><text start="118.6" dur="1.78">but it&amp;#39;s alright because everything will be fine</text><text start="120.38" dur="1.44">And nothing can ruin this</text><text start="122.02" dur="1.8">You&amp;#39;re in your 20&amp;#39;s now and some of your school friends</text><text start="123.82" dur="2.52">are becoming architects or doctors and you&amp;#39;re...</text><text start="126.34" dur="0.7">not</text><text start="127.22" dur="1.06">You wanted to be a...</text><text start="128.28" dur="0.5">whatever</text><text start="128.78" dur="1.52">but you&amp;#39;ve haven&amp;#39;t practiced it in years</text><text start="130.44" dur="1.24">You start practicing again</text><text start="131.68" dur="1.26">or planning to build a business</text><text start="132.94" dur="1.2">or get a masters</text><text start="134.14" dur="1.94">She seems thoroughly unimpressed by the idea</text><text start="136.34" dur="1.78">She starts making baby jokes or</text><text start="138.12" dur="1.18">talking about buying a house</text><text start="139.3" dur="1.18">You don&amp;#39;t really want the house</text><text start="140.48" dur="0.74">or a baby yet</text><text start="141.22" dur="1.44">because you&amp;#39;re not that thing you wanted to be</text><text start="142.7" dur="1.96">And you&amp;#39;re already 25 and 30 seems like a</text><text start="144.66" dur="2.06">very big number that&amp;#39;s getting scarily close</text><text start="147.34" dur="3.4">The sex is kinda routine now and you wonder if it&amp;#39;s just a chore for her</text><text start="150.74" dur="0.84">You still hang out</text><text start="151.58" dur="0.66">and it&amp;#39;s nice</text><text start="152.24" dur="1.58">but you begin to worry that something is missing</text><text start="154.12" dur="1.78">The two of you experiment with lingerie</text><text start="155.9" dur="0.92">and going for elaborate adventures</text><text start="156.82" dur="1.36">and that&amp;#39;s fun for a while</text><text start="158.36" dur="2.54">You go running some more and you see that girl again in the woods</text><text start="160.9" dur="0.92">There&amp;#39;s something sort of</text><text start="161.82" dur="1.1">otherworldly about her</text><text start="163.04" dur="0.88">She stops for breaths</text><text start="163.92" dur="0.88">so you do too</text><text start="164.8" dur="0.66">You say hello</text><text start="165.46" dur="1.2">She&amp;#39;s smart</text><text start="166.66" dur="1.84">Kinda calls you on your bullshit</text><text start="168.5" dur="0.78">And you like that</text><text start="169.42" dur="0.98">Then you carry on running,</text><text start="170.4" dur="1.24">and push her out of your mind,</text><text start="171.64" dur="2.06">but now you remember what butterflies feel like</text><text start="174.04" dur="0.88">You come home</text><text start="174.92" dur="2.02">You cook the same dish you had the night before,</text><text start="176.94" dur="1.02">and the night before that</text><text start="177.96" dur="1.38">You talk about nothing much</text><text start="179.34" dur="1.98">She mentions that guy from work wants to meet you</text><text start="181.32" dur="3.08">And you reply that guy from work can suck a thousand dicks in hell</text><text start="184.6" dur="1.78">You sit in awkward silence for a while</text><text start="186.38" dur="1.76">and then you watch some more TV</text><text start="188.78" dur="1.24">And some more TV</text><text start="190.22" dur="1.5">And you live like this for another year</text><text start="191.72" dur="0.76">And that&amp;#39;s fine</text><text start="192.48" dur="1.62">And nothing can ever ruin this</text><text start="194.28" dur="0.5">Ever</text><text start="195.84" dur="1.8">One of you screws someone else</text><text start="197.64" dur="1.38">or snaps for no reason</text><text start="199.02" dur="1.54">or mentions that you should take a break</text><text start="200.56" dur="0.9">or starts getting distant</text><text start="201.46" dur="1.48">or stops talking about the future</text><text start="202.94" dur="1.24">or whatever it is</text><text start="204.76" dur="1.72">Whether you were the one who broke it off or not,</text><text start="206.48" dur="2.46">you&amp;#39;re never going to wake up with her again or take her clothes off</text><text start="208.94" dur="2.7">or have anther screaming drunken argument about the European Union</text><text start="211.64" dur="1.58">or if dogs can look up or not</text><text start="213.42" dur="0.64">You go to bed</text><text start="214.06" dur="2.5">and suddenly the place smells of her in a way you&amp;#39;ve never noticed before</text><text start="216.56" dur="0.9">Music is shit</text><text start="217.46" dur="1">and food is shit</text><text start="218.46" dur="2">and everyone is shit however nice they are to you</text><text start="220.6" dur="1.46">And you know you&amp;#39;ve made a terrible mistake</text><text start="222.12" dur="1.14">Nothing can ruin this</text><text start="223.26" dur="1.86">and now everything is fucking ruined</text><text start="225.18" dur="1.1">You drink a lot of whiskey</text><text start="226.52" dur="1.94">You can&amp;#39;t seem to sleep for more than a few hours</text><text start="228.66" dur="2.78">Someone mentions that she&amp;#39;s been hanging out a lot with whatever his name is</text><text start="231.54" dur="2.64">You imagine them screwing briefly then go doing something else</text><text start="234.32" dur="1.22">You play a lot of video games</text><text start="235.54" dur="2.06">and discover that yes you do actually still have friends</text><text start="237.6" dur="2.5">and they&amp;#39;ve been patiently waiting for you for fucking years now</text><text start="240.2" dur="2.92">They listen to your bullshit politely because they&amp;#39;ve been through breakups too</text><text start="243.24" dur="1.76">They offer some nice little platitudes,</text><text start="245" dur="1.3">plenty of more fish in the sea,</text><text start="246.3" dur="0.5">etc</text><text start="246.82" dur="2.68">But you don&amp;#39;t really believe them because they weren&amp;#39;t really in love like you&amp;#39;re in love</text><text start="249.86" dur="1.8">No one has been in love like you&amp;#39;re in love</text><text start="251.76" dur="2.18">You and her send each other passive-aggressive texts</text><text start="253.94" dur="1.62">about getting your guitar back or whatever</text><text start="255.56" dur="1.5">And you meet up to swap your stuff over</text><text start="257.26" dur="2.18">It feels good to see her because you&amp;#39;re over it now</text><text start="259.44" dur="1.84">And she has no power over you whatsoever</text><text start="261.28" dur="1.4">And you&amp;#39;ll be moving on soon enough</text><text start="263.08" dur="1">You screw</text><text start="264.08" dur="2.78">and literally a minute later realize what a dumb mistake that was</text><text start="267.1" dur="1.8">You carry on screwing for a while</text><text start="268.98" dur="2.06">You begin to think about getting back together</text><text start="271.1" dur="1.62">She makes a few bullshit digs at you</text><text start="272.72" dur="1.16">or you make some at her</text><text start="273.94" dur="2.08">And suddenly you stop thinking about getting it back together</text><text start="276.7" dur="0.9">You argue</text><text start="277.6" dur="1.78">You say horrible shit,</text><text start="279.38" dur="2.6">the kind of stuff you imagine you won&amp;#39;t say to your worst enemies</text><text start="282.04" dur="1.4">You play some more video games</text><text start="283.44" dur="1.34">You drink some more whiskey</text><text start="284.78" dur="1.62">You listen to some more Elliot Smith</text><text start="286.62" dur="2.12">Things are going well with a girl you met on the train</text><text start="288.74" dur="2.7">But you can&amp;#39;t stomach the thought with sleeping with someone else</text><text start="291.76" dur="2">You briefly get into healthy eating</text><text start="293.76" dur="0.9">and having walks</text><text start="294.66" dur="2.5">and the benefits of keeping porn to a maximum of</text><text start="297.16" dur="1.8">17 one hour sessions a day</text><text start="299.18" dur="1.6">You keep practicing at that thing you love</text><text start="300.78" dur="1.66">You get pretty good at that thing you love</text><text start="302.44" dur="2.54">You remember what being human actually feels like</text><text start="305.04" dur="1.22">Someone tells you about a</text><text start="306.26" dur="1.34">sudden death in their family</text><text start="307.6" dur="2.58">and you realize you have absolutely nothing to feel sad about</text><text start="310.52" dur="0.68">Not really</text><text start="311.82" dur="2.48">Over time, people volunteer their own breakup stories</text><text start="314.3" dur="0.78">and some are far,</text><text start="315.08" dur="1.08">far worse than yours</text><text start="316.16" dur="0.74">And again,</text><text start="316.9" dur="2.62">you realize you have absolutely nothing to feel sad about</text><text start="319.52" dur="0.64">Not really</text><text start="320.5" dur="1.1">And subtly,</text><text start="321.6" dur="1.74">so subtly you don&amp;#39;t even notice</text><text start="323.34" dur="1.28">you become yourself again</text><text start="325.22" dur="1.78">And one day out of nowhere,</text><text start="327" dur="1.62">that girl you met running invites you out</text><text start="328.62" dur="2.36">And you notice this little birthmark on her shoulder</text><text start="330.98" dur="0.9">but you don&amp;#39;t mention it</text><text start="331.88" dur="0.98">And you stop sleeping,</text><text start="332.86" dur="0.56">and eating,</text><text start="333.42" dur="2.7">and whatever music you&amp;#39;re listening to at the moment will be so tied to her,</text><text start="336.14" dur="1.06">that in 20 years,</text><text start="337.2" dur="1.22">someone will play that song again</text><text start="338.42" dur="0.8">and just for a second,</text><text start="339.22" dur="1.82">you&amp;#39;ll remember exactly how you feel now</text><text start="341.16" dur="1.48">Music starts to sound good again</text><text start="342.64" dur="1.62">Food starts to taste good again</text><text start="344.26" dur="1.48">God what was all that about before?</text><text start="345.74" dur="1.28">Why were you being such a pussy?</text><text start="347.14" dur="0.68">Before long,</text><text start="347.82" dur="1.7">the two of you are hanging out every other day</text><text start="349.52" dur="2.02">and you can&amp;#39;t remember the last time you&amp;#39;ve felt so alive</text><text start="351.54" dur="1.92">Is this what you were meant to be doing all along?</text><text start="353.46" dur="2.42">Or maybe you&amp;#39;re just repeating the same dumb pattern again</text><text start="355.88" dur="1.58">but god, it feels incredible</text><text start="357.46" dur="2.58">Maybe the whole thing is just some stupid gamble but you don&amp;#39;t care</text><text start="360.04" dur="1.06">You didn&amp;#39;t care last time</text><text start="361.1" dur="1.92">Because right now, you&amp;#39;re sure of it</text><text start="363.02" dur="1.54">More sure than anything ever,</text><text start="364.56" dur="1.74">and anyone who tells you otherwise is an idiot</text><text start="366.5" dur="2.02">But nothing can ever ruin this</text><text start="368.52" dur="12.58">And nothing can ever ruin this</text></transcript>
