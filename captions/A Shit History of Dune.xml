The story starts on a planet about</text><text start="7.66" dur="5.72">20,000 years into the future where-Wait so several thousand years before the beginning of the book this guy called Holtzman gets into an accident</text><text start="13.38" dur="5.999">And just as he&amp;#39;s about to die someone uploads his brain Into a computer and he studies all of the physics and invents like interstellar</text><text start="19.39" dur="5.36">travel and tells everyone how to do it. Anyway, thousands of tears after that mankind has a galactic empire. There&amp;#39;s this itty-bitty</text><text start="25.029" dur="5">desert planet called Dune- Wait, hang on, so back up a second. We need to talk about the Bene Gesserit first who</text><text start="30.029" dur="1.991">were like the sacred order of chicks who have been around for ages</text><text start="32.02" dur="2">they can control people with a thing called &amp;quot;THE VOICE&amp;quot;</text><text start="35.02" dur="5.299">As, well as being resistant to poison, being able to choose the gender of their babies, choosing whether they conceive or not.</text><text start="43.39" dur="3.68">And they&amp;#39;ve had this breeding program going on for ages where they want to breed the Kwisatz Haderach</text><text start="47.32" dur="5.599">Which is this perfect godlike creature that used to conquer the Universe, okay so now, we get to Dune which Is this- oh shit</text><text start="52.92" dur="0.9">okay, wait, sorry</text><text start="53.82" dur="2.639">one more thing. Um, so robots got a bit like</text><text start="56.71" dur="5.45">mouthy a few thousand years ago so humans Just wiped them out and now it&amp;#39;s illegal to build an AI so everything has to be</text><text start="62.16" dur="1.539">done by humans, that means all</text><text start="63.699" dur="5.96">multiplication, addition and piloting fucking spaceships, so this class of people exists called the Mentats who are these slick</text><text start="69.729" dur="4.639">goofy head cats who are super duper clever. Now anyone who&amp;#39;s anyone has their own personal Mentat for</text><text start="74.5" dur="2.72">strategizing or crossword puzzles or whatever and they come in three different flavors:</text><text start="77.95" dur="3.919">Hypothesizers who hypothesize, Memorizers who memorize and Processers who</text><text start="81.869" dur="4.5">Well, you get it, yeah? So this brings us to Dune, which is really called Arrakis, where the story starts with</text><text start="86.369" dur="4.5">Oh... yeah uh the emperor of the Galaxy is called the Emperor and he just, like, rules stuff</text><text start="90.869" dur="6.24">Cuz yeah. So Dune is- Oh and there&amp;#39;s this stuff called spice and it&amp;#39;s pretty much the most expensive commodity in the Universe because it</text><text start="97.11" dur="2.61">slows aging and pilots use it to guide spaceships and Bene Gesserit chicks</text><text start="99.79" dur="3.529">take it to recall everything that happened to their ancestors ever (a bit like</text><text start="103.36" dur="5.69">Assassin&amp;#39;s Creed but... better) and you can use it to make coats too and hats so that&amp;#39;s nice, isn&amp;#39;t it?</text><text start="109.11" dur="4.47">And the only place you can get spice is- 
Oh fuck what&amp;#39;s it called? Uh uuh DUUUUUNE</text><text start="114.19" dur="1.789">Yes welcome to Arrakis</text><text start="115.979" dur="4.169">also known as Dune a desert planet where it&amp;#39;s so hot you have to wear a special suit to keep the moisture in your body</text><text start="120.149" dur="4.2">and 100-foot sandworms chill in The desert and eat people. So there&amp;#39;s the indigenous population, the Fremen,</text><text start="124.35" dur="4.019">who have sexy blue glowing eyes because they use so much spice, and then there are the Houses. On Dune</text><text start="128.369" dur="5.22">we find House Harkonnen, who are generally quite fats and enjoy torture, and House Atreides, who are pretty good-looking and the governed by this</text><text start="133.59" dur="1.18">guy called Leto Atreides.</text><text start="134.77" dur="5.449">Leto has a son called Paul and a wife who&amp;#39;s kind of secretly Bene Gesserit and was supposed to have a daughter but loved</text><text start="140.22" dur="4.949">Leto so much she gave him a son instead, and the Bene Gesserit are, like, quite pissed about this because it sort of fucked up their</text><text start="145.17" dur="5.07">breeding program, and the whole Atreides family have come to Dune to wrestle control the spice from the Harkonnen, who were probably just eating it anyway.</text><text start="150.24" dur="6">Things go, uh, less than well and the Harkonnen&amp;#39;s pretty much destroyed, House Atreides killing Leto and forcing</text><text start="156.24" dur="1.65">his wife and child into the desert. There they</text><text start="157.89" dur="5.19">Join forces with the Fremen and Jessica teaches them to do all that Bene Gesserit nonsense and everyone becomes a wizard. Jessica drinks</text><text start="163.209" dur="3.5">concentrated spice becoming a cosmic badass meanwhile bestowing the same power</text><text start="166.709" dur="4.08">on her Daughter Alia, who is still in the womb. After loads of spice and having all that training from his mom</text><text start="170.94" dur="5.029">Paul begins to see into the future and concocts a plan to begin the jihad against the Harkonnen using the Fremen. However, he</text><text start="175.97" dur="4.35">also sees that if he&amp;#39;s not careful the Fremen will go too far with it and take the jihad out into space and just generally</text><text start="180.32" dur="2.789">fuck everything up. Just for good measure, he knocks up a Fremen chick</text><text start="183.11" dur="5.4">and has a son who he calls Leto after his dead father but he gets a bit like killed later so we don&amp;#39;t have to talk about him.</text><text start="188.51" dur="5.25">Meanwhile Alia, Paul&amp;#39;s wizardy sister, is captured by the Harkonnen but it&amp;#39;s alright because she kills the Baron Harkonnen because she&amp;#39;s, you know,</text><text start="193.76" dur="4.949">got wizard shit going on. Paul has more or less become the head of the Fremen and under the cover of a sandstorm leads an</text><text start="198.71" dur="5.369">attack on the capital city where the Harkonnens are hauled up. He confronts the newly installed baron Harkonnen, who&amp;#39;s like &amp;quot;Could you fuck</text><text start="204.08" dur="4.979">off a bit, please?&amp;quot; and Paul stabs him up quite bad. And now in control of Arrakis, Paul gives the Emperor a little ring on</text><text start="209.06" dur="2.01">the old dog and bone and says &amp;quot;Alright  you old China (?)</text><text start="211.2" dur="1.44">yeah, that spice thing</text><text start="212.64" dur="3.62">Uh that&amp;#39;s mine now so if you don&amp;#39;t stop being Emperor I&amp;#39;m gonna blow it all up and that means</text><text start="216.26" dur="2.91">no more space travel. Okay?&amp;quot; And he gives the Bene Gesserit a ring aswell</text><text start="219.17" dur="4.529">and says much the same thing and everyone pretty much bows down to Paul and Paul becomes Johnny Big Balls of Dune and the</text><text start="223.7" dur="2">Galaxy. Marries the daughter to the Emperor and</text><text start="225.93" dur="3.02">GAME OV- except in his visions of the future he realizes even though he</text><text start="228.95" dur="4.469">was really careful the Fremen are still gonna take their jihad out to the stars anyway, so good job Paul, good job.</text><text start="233.49" dur="2">But what a bloody pickle you&amp;#39;re in now, eh? DUUUUUUNE</text></transcript>
