of mindless drudgery and tedium you&amp;#39;ve affectionately come to refer to as</text><text start="6.8" dur="1.38">&amp;quot;your life&amp;quot;?</text><text start="8.4" dur="2.52">Convinced that everyone else has their ducks in a row,</text><text start="10.92" dur="5.42">while you lurch from disaster to disaster like some rickety tandem Victorian velocipede?</text><text start="16.34" dur="2.14">Caught in a perpetual cycle of feeling good,</text><text start="18.48" dur="0.94">feeling medium,</text><text start="19.42" dur="1.7">then returning to feeling like crap again,</text><text start="21.12" dur="3.82">waiting for the day when you&amp;#39;ll actually find yourself in a good mood for more than five minutes?</text><text start="25.5" dur="2.32">Well, there is quite a good reason for some of that,</text><text start="27.82" dur="2.08">and it begins, as we all did,</text><text start="29.9" dur="1.24">with biology.</text><text start="31.74" dur="3.18">Nature uses two methods of making babies on our planet:</text><text start="34.92" dur="1.5">&amp;quot;boink&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;no boink&amp;quot;.</text><text start="36.42" dur="4.6">&amp;quot;No boink&amp;quot;, or asexual reproduction, is generally used by bacteria, plants, and fungi,</text><text start="41.02" dur="3.58">and it involves an organism copying its genetic material for the next generation.</text><text start="44.6" dur="3.98">&amp;quot;Boink&amp;quot;, or sexual reproduction, usually involves a male and a female doing the nasty</text><text start="48.58" dur="2.66">and combining their DNA 50/50 to produce offspring.</text><text start="51.24" dur="1.62">And that&amp;#39;s the one we&amp;#39;ll focus on here.</text><text start="52.86" dur="4.18">Species change over time due to two main factors: selection and mutation.</text><text start="57.04" dur="5.5">Selection means the organisms better suited to their environment have more chance of surviving – and so, reproducing.</text><text start="62.54" dur="5.1">They will also often choose mating partners with what they consider attractive qualities, or &amp;quot;phenotypes&amp;quot;.</text><text start="67.64" dur="2.62">For example, often deer like big antlers,</text><text start="70.26" dur="1.64">peahens like colorful plumage,</text><text start="71.9" dur="4.68">the male bowerbird attempts to attract ladies in the form of a bachelor pad called a bower,</text><text start="76.58" dur="2.08">which takes sometimes months to decorate.</text><text start="78.66" dur="1.3">Stupid birds!</text><text start="79.96" dur="3.66">Humans would never make such silly displays for mating purposes!</text><text start="83.62" dur="1.86">Would... we?..</text><text start="87" dur="1.62">The second trick is mutation.</text><text start="88.62" dur="3.24">Mutation means that sometimes there are glitches in the DNA of offspring,</text><text start="91.86" dur="2.9">and this could be due to copying errors, or even cosmic rays.</text><text start="94.76" dur="3.52">In humans, it can mean anything from red hair to genetic diseases.</text><text start="98.28" dur="3.9">Sometimes these mutations will then be passed down to the next generation of offspring,</text><text start="102.18" dur="2.84">and, if they&amp;#39;re beneficial for survival, will be sexually selected,</text><text start="105.02" dur="2.78">and even become a characteristic feature of the species.</text><text start="107.8" dur="4.18">Through circumstances we still don&amp;#39;t understand, humans have developed relatively large brains</text><text start="111.98" dur="3.66">and outsmarted, nom&amp;#39;d, or avoided every other species on the planet –</text><text start="115.64" dur="1.76">good old survival of the shittest.</text><text start="117.4" dur="2.56">And while we pride ourselves on being fantastically clever,</text><text start="119.96" dur="4.78">very little has actually changed in terms of hardware between prehistoric humans and modern humans,</text><text start="124.74" dur="2.44">because evolution takes ages, as we know.</text><text start="127.18" dur="2.24">Now, modern humans are sneaky, of course:</text><text start="129.42" dur="3.86">we&amp;#39;ve taken the old evolutionary urges and drives, and found ways to still enjoy them.</text><text start="133.28" dur="2.9">Aggressive combat into competitive martial arts, for example.</text><text start="136.18" dur="2.12">Or a constant obsession with reproduction</text><text start="138.3" dur="4.34">turned into an act you can do thousands of times across your lifespan, and never actually make offspring.</text><text start="142.64" dur="2.7">But evolution is not a smart or conscious process –</text><text start="145.34" dur="1.82">some things are NOT well-designed.</text><text start="147.16" dur="5.34">A narrow pelvis, for example, making childbirth a thoroughly enjoyable experience for women everywhere.</text><text start="152.5" dur="4.28">Or standing up, which, in return for a better line of sight and an ability to grab stuff,</text><text start="156.78" dur="3.18">also kindly gave us sciatica and hemorrhoids in return.</text><text start="159.96" dur="4.1">However, we&amp;#39;ve also inherited the mental traits evolution kindly gave to our ancestors,</text><text start="164.06" dur="1.38">including creativity,</text><text start="165.44" dur="0.82">curiosity,</text><text start="166.26" dur="0.78">speech,</text><text start="167.04" dur="1.46">a low anxiety threshold,</text><text start="168.5" dur="1.66">a bit of a tendency for pessimism,</text><text start="170.16" dur="3.26">and a total inability to keep right on the London Underground escalators.</text><text start="173.42" dur="1.76">The signs are fucking everywhere!!</text><text start="175.18" dur="3.48">We are a contradictory mix of animal and mad god.</text><text start="178.66" dur="5.8">But we may be, this century, on the threshold of gaining technologies to alter our evolutionary blueprint,</text><text start="184.46" dur="2.06">courtesy of genetic engineering.</text><text start="186.52" dur="3.4">Going into our genome and ripping up the floorboards.</text><text start="189.92" dur="2.12">So what shall we do then?</text><text start="192.04" dur="2.44">Make ourselves harder, better, faster, stronger;</text><text start="194.48" dur="0.98">eyes on elbows;</text><text start="195.46" dur="4.38">an ability to actually piss in a straight line first thing in the morning – all very interesting,</text><text start="199.84" dur="3.46">but there is one particular evolutionary bad boy we might rewire,</text><text start="203.3" dur="3.76">that&amp;#39;s so fundamental to the human condition we barely even notice it&amp;#39;s there.</text><text start="207.06" dur="1.08">And its name...</text><text start="208.14" dur="1.32">is &amp;quot;misery&amp;quot;.</text><text start="210.3" dur="3.16">We are not designed for sustained happiness or optimism.</text><text start="213.46" dur="4.48">Natural selection had very little interest in our mental welfare – survival was key.</text><text start="217.94" dur="5.84">As a result, it seems most of us, regardless of geography or social standing, have a hedonic set point –</text><text start="223.78" dur="2.68">that is, something good might happen, and you&amp;#39;ll feel good for a while;</text><text start="226.46" dur="2.44">something bad might happen, and you&amp;#39;ll feel bad for a while;</text><text start="228.9" dur="4.76">but eventually you will probably return to your baseline, which appears to be set out of your control –</text><text start="233.66" dur="1.36">partly genetically.</text><text start="235.02" dur="2.6">For some individuals, this set point is rather high;</text><text start="237.62" dur="1.5">for the rest of us, though...</text><text start="239.12" dur="0.98">Yeah, not...</text><text start="240.1" dur="1.6">NOT SO MUCH.</text><text start="241.7" dur="3.12">And that&amp;#39;s ignoring all the other pitfalls of brain 1.0,</text><text start="244.82" dur="1.56">including age-related dementia,</text><text start="246.38" dur="0.9">self-loathing,</text><text start="247.28" dur="1.56">a tendency towards addiction,</text><text start="248.84" dur="1.6">a tendency towards addiction...</text><text start="250.44" dur="1.82">A TENDENCY TOWARDS ADDICTION!..</text><text start="252.26" dur="1.26">low boredom thresholds,</text><text start="253.52" dur="3.08">and everything else we didn&amp;#39;t ask for, genetically speaking.</text><text start="256.6" dur="2.34">These nasties have haunted us for millennia,</text><text start="258.94" dur="3.58">and they seem to form part of what we&amp;#39;ve lovingly come to know as the human condition,</text><text start="262.52" dur="2.24">which for many of us is just shorthand for</text><text start="264.76" dur="2.6">&amp;quot;stuff we can&amp;#39;t change, and we&amp;#39;re shit, and it&amp;#39;s natural,</text><text start="267.36" dur="1.66">and have a cup of tea and get on with it.&amp;quot;</text><text start="269.02" dur="4.02">But if we crack the ability to send these evolutionary dishes back to the kitchen,</text><text start="273.04" dur="2.58">to engineer ourselves happier or more content...</text><text start="275.62" dur="3.28">Shall we fucking give it a whirl, or... not?</text><text start="278.9" dur="5.44">After all, we&amp;#39;ve got such a great track record with limiting the few godlike powers we already have...</text><text start="284.34" dur="1.04">*ahem...*</text><text start="285.38" dur="0.92">*ahem..*</text><text start="286.3"

dur="0.64">*cough*</text><text start="292.82" dur="2.68">If we do gain mastery over our own genetics,</text><text start="295.5" dur="1.68">how far should we go with this one?</text><text start="297.18" dur="2.98">And... how the hell will we know... when to stop?</text><text start="300.88" dur="3.94">Now, luckily, genetic engineering is really simple, and there are no risks,</text><text start="304.82" dur="2.28">and genetic engineering is really simple</text><text start="307.1" dur="2.16">You see, there&amp;#39;s a single gene for everything:</text><text start="309.26" dur="3.16">a cleverness gene, a tallness gene, a really good-looking gene,</text><text start="312.42" dur="4.14">and they can just be turned on and off without affecting anything else, and there being no bad consequences,</text><text start="316.56" dur="2.32">and genetic engineering is really simple –</text><text start="318.88" dur="5.46">there&amp;#39;s definitely no risk of making horrific alterations to the human genome that only become apparent generations later,</text><text start="324.34" dur="5.06">there&amp;#39;s no risk of nasty folks creating engineered drug resistant pandemics that are virtually impossible to eradicate,</text><text start="329.4" dur="5.38">there&amp;#39;s certainly no risk of a group of us getting hold of the technology and creating an entirely separate genus of humans</text><text start="334.78" dur="3.08">we can&amp;#39;t possibly compete with in any aspect whatsoever.</text><text start="337.86" dur="5.36">Genetic engineering is unbelievably complicated, and it&amp;#39;s not hard to see why people are extremely cautious.</text><text start="343.22" dur="4.38">We are currently children who have just about learned the genetic alphabet, but we can&amp;#39;t read yet.</text><text start="347.6" dur="3.2">So what can the new genetic technologies actually do?</text><text start="350.8" dur="2.14">Well, in each of our cells is DNA.</text><text start="352.94" dur="1.78">DNA is packed within chromosomes.</text><text start="354.72" dur="3.44">Chromosomes are extremely long strings of DNA composed of four bases:</text><text start="358.16" dur="1.34">A, T, C, and G.</text><text start="359.5" dur="4.3">Lengths of these are called &amp;quot;genes&amp;quot;, and proteins are built inside your body as a result of genes.</text><text start="363.8" dur="3.62">If you like, genes are genetic verbs telling proteins what to do.</text><text start="367.42" dur="2.42">We&amp;#39;ve been genetic engineers for four centuries now,</text><text start="369.84" dur="3.8">breeding species for the sake of characteristics we want – in doggies, for example:</text><text start="373.64" dur="2.44">small ones,
big ones,
the bestest ones...</text><text start="376.08" dur="1.64">...fucking love Springer Spaniels...</text><text start="377.72" dur="1.88">But even that goes wrong sometimes.</text><text start="379.6" dur="1.84">Many species of doggies are adorable,</text><text start="381.44" dur="4.66">but possess nasty inherited traits like hip dysplasia and epilepsy – thanks to us.</text><text start="386.1" dur="3.54">And this is just simple genetic engineering we haven&amp;#39;t managed to get right yet.</text><text start="389.64" dur="4.52">So far, we&amp;#39;ve been using hammer methods, but now we may be holding a scalpel method called CRISPR,</text><text start="394.16" dur="2.92">and it works – roughly, briefly – like so:</text><text start="397.08" dur="4.94">Some bacteria can store an intruder&amp;#39;s DNA in their own DNA in the genetic library called CRISPR,</text><text start="402.02" dur="2.82">or Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats,</text><text start="404.84" dur="5.72">and using that as a template, using an enzyme called Cas9 it can kick ass if the intruder comes around again.</text><text start="410.56" dur="5.36">Researchers have hijacked this trick, and have begun to use it to snip out targeted sections of DNA in other organisms.</text><text start="415.92" dur="3.68">Considering there are thousands of diseases caused by a mistake of just one letter,</text><text start="419.6" dur="4.82">not too much alteration might be needed to fix all sorts of nasties latent in human DNA.</text><text start="424.42" dur="3.86">This isn&amp;#39;t a question of IF we start radically altering human biology – it&amp;#39;s WHEN,</text><text start="428.28" dur="4.26">because even if most of us condemn the technology, it&amp;#39;s not as if other researchers won&amp;#39;t pursue it –</text><text start="432.54" dur="1.34">they&amp;#39;ve started already.</text><text start="433.88" dur="3.24">Obviously, hopefully, we&amp;#39;ll begin with eliminating genetic disorders,</text><text start="437.12" dur="4.32">but surely there will come a point, perhaps this century, when we get a little bit more experimental.</text><text start="441.44" dur="2">And the question is, what happens then?</text><text start="443.44" dur="1.76">Well, we might be children at the moment,</text><text start="445.2" dur="4.24">but we know enough to notice that certain genes, when they&amp;#39;re present, accompany specific traits.</text><text start="449.44" dur="5.92">DEC2, for example, is a genetic mutation allowing some of the humans who have it to survive on around 6 hours sleep a night.</text><text start="455.36" dur="2.94">But genetics is rarely &amp;quot;one gene equals one trait&amp;quot;.</text><text start="458.3" dur="1.68">There isn&amp;#39;t one intelligence gene,</text><text start="459.98" dur="4.14">and there probably isn&amp;#39;t going to be a single &amp;quot;depression&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;makes hummus delicious&amp;quot; gene, either.</text><text start="464.12" dur="4.64">What we know from twin studies, though, is that somehow very specific traits CAN be inherited.</text><text start="468.76" dur="1.96">There may not be a single &amp;quot;good at violin&amp;quot; gene,</text><text start="470.72" dur="2.96">but there might be a bunch of genes that go INTO being good at the violin</text><text start="473.68" dur="4.76">that one might inherit from their parents, like decent hand-eye coordination and pitch sensitivity.</text><text start="478.44" dur="2.86">But in any case genetics is not a switchboard –</text><text start="481.3" dur="2.84">happy on, sad off, bada-bing, let&amp;#39;s go for a pint –</text><text start="484.14" dur="5.12">it is an interconnected tapestry in which some traits are caused by loads of genes, potentially thousands,</text><text start="489.26" dur="2.98">and small alterations could have horrific consequences.</text><text start="492.24" dur="4.6">There&amp;#39;s nothing prudish about being cautious when it comes to a cheeky bit of the old &amp;quot;playing God&amp;quot;.</text><text start="497.18" dur="2.1">Let&amp;#39;s plant a flag there for a moment,</text><text start="499.28" dur="4.3">because if we do one day learn to speak fluent Genetics, alongside changing ourselves physically,</text><text start="503.58" dur="2.44">(and potentially shepherding in the FUCKING APOCALYPSE!)</text><text start="506.02" dur="3.92">We could scout out the roots of the more unpleasant aspects of the human condition –</text><text start="509.94" dur="1.02">of low mood,</text><text start="510.96" dur="0.88">of self-hate,</text><text start="511.84" dur="0.76">of depression,</text><text start="512.6" dur="0.82">anxiety,</text><text start="513.42" dur="1.14">of the hedonic curse –</text><text start="514.56" dur="2.8">of the genetic foundations of misery itself.</text><text start="517.36" dur="3.98">And if for some reason this all goes well – which there&amp;#39;s no reason to suggest that it has to –</text><text start="521.34" dur="2.3">then you and I might be living in the last century</text><text start="523.64" dur="3.86">in which anyone was ever involuntarily suffering, mentally speaking.</text><text start="527.82" dur="4.42">Mental well-being is, I would argue, the most important factor in being alive,</text><text start="532.24" dur="3.04">because it&amp;#39;s the first thing that makes being alive WORTH being alive.</text><text start="535.28" dur="2.9">Like, if you weren&amp;#39;t conscious, nothing else would matter.</text><text start="538.18" dur="5.74">And even if you lived in a solid-gold mansion, and slept on a bed made of Fabergé eggs, and brushed your teeth with dolla dolla bills –</text><text start="543.92" dur="2.24">if you&amp;#39;re miserable, you&amp;#39;re still miserable.</text><text start="546.16" dur="1.84">Gucci gang, Gucci gang.</text><text start="548" dur="2.98">If there&amp;#39;s a possibility of one day altering the human condition,</text><text start="550.98" dur="4.94">perhaps the goal should be to preserve our humanity, but attempt to overthrow our evolutionary curses.</text><text start="555.92" dur="4.08">For example, using these new technologies to raise an individual&amp;#39;s baseline happiness default</text><text start="560" dur="2.48">without compromising the individual&amp;#39;s personality.</text><text start="562.48" dur="3.74">Much like the difference between you with a hangover and you after a workout, and-</text><text start="566.22" dur="3.16">Oh!

spaces –</text><text start="714.2" dur="3.98">spaces unconstrained by our usual evolutionary baseline architecture.</text><text start="718.18" dur="3.58">Tomorrow&amp;#39;s genetic explorers may go in search of these spaces,</text><text start="721.76" dur="3.4">rewiring the perceptual and reward centers of their brains.</text><text start="725.16" dur="2.22">If that happens, it will seem bizarre to them</text><text start="727.38" dur="4.1">that for the whole of our history we occupied only the ground floor of human experience,</text><text start="731.48" dur="2.36">and except for the occasional hallucinogenic dabbling,</text><text start="733.84" dur="3.2">never took the elevator up or down to those other strange floors –</text><text start="737.04" dur="1.42">to boundless optimism,</text><text start="738.46" dur="3.48">to entire lifetimes free of self-loathing or anxiety,</text><text start="741.94" dur="3.26">ignorant of the molecular and genetic foundations of misery,</text><text start="745.2" dur="3.7">much in the fashion that disease was once thought caused by bad smells;</text><text start="748.9" dur="3.28">back when we lived in an era in which we had more control over the atom</text><text start="752.18" dur="2.78">than we had over our own internal circuitry;</text><text start="754.96" dur="3.92">that somehow we survived the psychochemical Dark Ages.</text><text start="758.88" dur="2.72">Will we lose ourselves to radical transformation?</text><text start="761.6" dur="2.96">Will we venture too far into the experimental forest –</text><text start="764.56" dur="3.34">a world in which we fracture into so many variations of humanity</text><text start="767.9" dur="1.94">we can no longer communicate with each other,</text><text start="769.84" dur="4.22">a world in which one can make a living scouting out these new strange humans,</text><text start="774.06" dur="3.52">much as an anthropologist seeks our new cultures today?</text><text start="777.58" dur="1.48">We have no idea.</text><text start="779.06" dur="3.94">We are a limited species who may be about to gain unlimited power.</text><text start="783" dur="1.64">And what happens then?</text><text start="784.64" dur="4.2">What becomes of the human condition when the genetic shackles have been taken off?</text><text start="788.84" dur="4.66">There will be plenty of moral problems of technology for our children&amp;#39;s children to face,</text><text start="793.5" dur="3.38">but one of them is bound to be the issue of human modification,</text><text start="796.88" dur="3.04">and, by extension, modification of the human condition.</text><text start="799.92" dur="2.6">We currently have no compass to show us the way,</text><text start="802.52" dur="3.52">as we set out on this new, very possibly perilous expedition</text><text start="806.04" dur="2.1">into our own source code.</text><text start="808.14" dur="2.58">As John says in Brave New World:</text><text start="810.72" dur="1.28">&amp;quot;But I don&amp;#39;t want comfort.</text><text start="812" dur="3.38">I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger,</text><text start="815.38" dur="2.14">I want freedom, I want goodness.</text><text start="817.52" dur="1.18">I want sin.&amp;quot;</text><text start="819.08" dur="3.62">And why should we edit out the strange edges of the human condition?</text><text start="822.7" dur="3.66">We are a uniquely batshit species, and that is lovely.</text><text start="826.36" dur="2.4">But there is a difference between eccentricity</text><text start="828.76" dur="4.3">and suffering at the hands of a mental legacy we inherited from nature.</text><text start="833.92" dur="4">We still bear the evolutionary scars of our rise through the ranks of the animals,</text><text start="837.92" dur="1.9">of our helpless infancy in the ocean,</text><text start="839.82" dur="3.4">and then of our traumatic childhood on the savannah plains of Africa.</text><text start="843.22" dur="3.8">and as a result of those millions of years of ruthless evolutionary pressure,</text><text start="847.02" dur="4">we have matured into a very peculiar mix of aggression and diplomacy,</text><text start="851.02" dur="2.04">willful ignorance and curiosity,</text><text start="853.06" dur="1.74">chaos and smarts.</text><text start="854.8" dur="2.48">We have enough problems today as it is.</text><text start="857.28" dur="6.04">Just considering disease and mortality, gastroenteritis alone kills about 1.8 million kids a year,</text><text start="863.32" dur="4.26">and that&amp;#39;s to say nothing of cancer, malaria, and tuberculosis.</text><text start="867.58" dur="4.08">But slowly, thanks to the conscientious among us, they are on the run.</text><text start="871.66" dur="4.04">And it is conceivable that one day humans will live on a planet free of disease</text><text start="875.7" dur="3.26">and free of premature death at the hands of nature.</text><text start="878.96" dur="2.34">And as we relegate these demons to history,</text><text start="881.3" dur="4.94">we will surely pause to cast an eye on those involuntary mental maladies as well –</text><text start="886.24" dur="3.54">the specters of despair, of depression, of anxiety –</text><text start="889.78" dur="2.68">and wonder if we might banish those, too.</text><text start="892.46" dur="3.26">&amp;quot;Was&amp;quot; must be the most lovely word in the English language.</text><text start="895.72" dur="4.58">It tells you everything you need to know about our ingenuity and compassion as a species.</text><text start="900.3" dur="6.36">If you look up smallpox today, often the first two words of the definition will read &amp;quot;smallpox was&amp;quot;.</text><text start="906.66" dur="0.86">&amp;quot;Was&amp;quot;.</text><text start="907.52" dur="3.6">We collectively gave it a fucking roundhouse kick and yelled: &amp;quot;stay down, you c**t!&amp;quot;</text><text start="911.12" dur="1.3">And it stayed down.</text><text start="912.42" dur="3.2">If everything goes well as we mature as a species,</text><text start="915.62" dur="3.96">the word &amp;quot;was&amp;quot; will propagate steadily throughout our encyclopedias.</text><text start="919.58" dur="5.44">And perhaps centuries from today, some future child will stumble on some future incarnation of Wikipedia</text><text start="925.02" dur="4.68">and come upon obscure and forgotten diseases and afflictions of the human being –</text><text start="929.7" dur="2.98">couched again and again, relentlessly,</text><text start="932.68" dur="2.32">in the wonderful past tense:</text><text start="935.62" dur="8.28">&amp;quot;Cancer was a group of diseases
