Well...</text><text start="7.42" dur="3.8">This is General Relativity and Quantum Field Theory. Both are good descriptions of the universe</text><text start="11.32" dur="3.86">but they don&amp;#39;t match up. Which is weird because they both describe the same universe.</text><text start="15.36" dur="4.76">Or if you put them together you get a message from the universe to physicists trying to understand it:</text><text start="20.12" dur="1.76">&amp;#39;&amp;#39;God Recommends You Quit Fucking Trying&amp;#39;&amp;#39;</text><text start="22.1" dur="5.12">General Relativity is the brainchild of Einstein, the king of science himself, and more or less says that gravity is</text><text start="27.22" dur="7.24">a geometric property of space and time. Meaning space and time can also be distorted. For more information see black holes, high speeds, and pot brownies.</text><text start="34.78" dur="6.02">Quantum Field Theory on the other hand, describes the very little world of the subatomic and says that particles are what you get when you excite fields.</text><text start="40.8" dur="2.97">Humans like describing complex phenomena with models.</text><text start="43.77" dur="2.069">We did it with economics and computer science</text><text start="45.84" dur="2.18">and the British political system...</text><text start="48.02" dur="3.44">The Dream™, is to finally do it in physics with relativity and quantum mechanics</text><text start="51.46" dur="4.12">and get them to take their clothes off together and get their freak on. This would revolutionize science.</text><text start="56.04" dur="4.4">However there are some serious compatibility issues and lots of the problems come from the Standard Model.</text><text start="60.54" dur="1.44">Last week we touched on the Standard Model</text><text start="61.98" dur="2.219">Which is a pretty nifty description of how matter works.</text><text start="64.2" dur="3.22">But there is still some outstanding homework to be done by humanity.</text><text start="67.42" dur="3.14">Firstly: Symmetry. Normally nature is a pretty classy girl</text><text start="70.56" dur="3.209">but in this case she&amp;#39;s gone all loosey-goosey. Almost everything in nature is</text><text start="73.96" dur="2.452">symmetrical when we look deeply enough into her( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)</text><text start="76.412" dur="0.748">or &amp;#39;&amp;#39;it&amp;#39;&amp;#39;, rather.</text><text start="77.34" dur="5.54">This can be seen from honeycombs, to galaxies to the first very good seasons of Dexter to the *other ones*</text><text start="83.04" dur="3.18">However physics is currently not very symmetrical and we don&amp;#39;t know why.</text><text start="86.47" dur="4.009">Problem &amp;#39;&amp;#39;deux&amp;#39;&amp;#39;:  Dark matter.  The universe is behaving a bit oddly at the moment and while</text><text start="90.479" dur="3.959">it seems overweight when it gets on the scales, we can&amp;#39;t seem to find all that extra mass anywhere.</text><text start="94.44" dur="5.44">This is where dark matter comes in which is an invisible mystery ingredient, that the Standard Model currently can&amp;#39;t explain.</text><text start="99.88" dur="2.279">Thirdly: Gravity - we all know it exists.</text><text start="102.16" dur="1.6">(Especially my ex-girlfriend)</text><text start="103.76" dur="2.76">(HORROR SCREAM)</text><text start="106.52" dur="1.72">*crash*</text><text start="110.34" dur="4.82">But the Standard Model currently takes the approach of &amp;#39;&amp;#39;Lalalalalala gravitons maybe, don&amp;#39;t want to talk about it. Oh look. A kestrel&amp;#39;&amp;#39;</text><text start="115.42" dur="1.44">(BIRD SQUAWKS)</text><text start="117.06" dur="6.68">What we need, is a theory of everything that explains gravity and dark matter and reunites relativity with quantum mechanics and does a little</text><text start="123.84" dur="4.94">backflip for a cheeky encore. Here are some delicious theory of everything recipes that scientists have tried so far.</text><text start="129.12" dur="3.96">Recipe one: String theory cake. To bake a string theory cake you will need:</text><text start="133.08" dur="6.28">Several kilograms of scientific optimism, a jar of hidden spatial dimensions and a sprinkle of supersymmetry. The basic idea is this:</text><text start="139.47" dur="2.659">Just like the strings of a violin can play lots of different notes</text><text start="142.34" dur="5.66">particles may be made of common objects, called &amp;#39;&amp;#39;strings&amp;#39;&amp;#39;. If they vibrate at different frequencies they create different particles.</text><text start="148.88" dur="3.46">(VIOLIN PLAYS NOTES)</text><text start="152.7" dur="3.9">One of them may even be a graviton, finally explaining what gravity actually is.</text><text start="156.84" dur="1.02">(EXCITED VIOLIN)</text><text start="158.42" dur="6.22">However, string theory wasn&amp;#39;t happy with the usual missionary position, of three dimensions of space and one dimension of time that we&amp;#39;re used to.</text><text start="164.82" dur="3.6">No - In some versions she needs 26 dimensions to make the maths work.</text><text start="168.44" dur="5.98">Anything else we can get for you String Theory, cup of tea, massage, fucking private jet, you insufferable diva??</text><text start="174.54" dur="6.88">Recipe number two: Loop quantum gravity cake. Combine a little self raising flour with the tears of Michio Kaku and voilá!</text><text start="181.42" dur="4.54">Loop quantum gravity is string theory&amp;#39;s slightly more awkward, but still very clever, main competitor.</text><text start="185.96" dur="3.76">If gravity really is a property of space-time, like some scientists believe it is</text><text start="189.8" dur="1">*ahem-hem*</text><text start="190.84" dur="5.72">Instead space might be made of loops forming something called a &amp;#39;&amp;#39;spin foam&amp;#39;&amp;#39;. And even though it doesn&amp;#39;t explain everything yet</text><text start="196.58" dur="4.24">it does kind of explain gravity. So. You know. That&amp;#39;s all right, isn&amp;#39;t it?</text><text start="200.82" dur="4.4">Recipe three: Miscellaneous. There are plenty of other theories of everything such as:</text><text start="205.22" dur="6.26">Causal Dynamical Triangulation, which divides space-time into dinky little triangles and solves a number of problems that way.</text><text start="211.48" dur="6.34">Or Modified Newtonian Dynamics, which tries to explain dark matter away, by sitting Isaac Newton down and giving him a stern talking-to.</text><text start="218.1" dur="5">Or the E8 Model, which is very pretty geometric explanation for how all particles interact with each other.</text><text start="223.34" dur="5.26">And finally, Recipe number four: Shut up, no cake for you. Also known as Gödel&amp;#39;s Incompleteness Theorem.</text><text start="228.6" dur="6.86">Mathematician Kurt Gödel decided to give everyone the finger in 1931, by pointing out that no system of mathematics is self contained.</text><text start="235.6" dur="2.82">Or, to put it another way, if you have any arithmetic in a system</text><text start="238.519" dur="4.5">there&amp;#39;ll be things you can never ever prove for certain. That might mean, according to Gödel, that we can</text><text start="243.16" dur="2.66">have a true theory of everything, so thanks for that.</text><text start="247.32" dur="0.6">Dick.</text><text start="248.46" dur="1.48">Anyway, these are all fun ideas.</text><text start="249.94" dur="3.62">But maybe none of them are correct and the real answer will turn up unexpectedly one day.</text><text start="253.56" dur="4.08">With very little warning. At a totally inappropriate moment without our permission.</text><text start="258.1" dur="4.1">Much like a certain Windows update, Microsoft, you bunch of total cun-</text></transcript>
