<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.12" dur="3.21">Oh look, it’s no aliens.</text><text start="3.33" dur="1.58">No aliens there.</text><text start="4.91" dur="1.339">No aliens there.</text><text start="6.249" dur="3.541">And just over here, a distinct lack of aliens.</text><text start="9.79" dur="3.53">In any case there are three fairly good reasons
why they probably still haven’t said hello yet</text><text start="13.32" dur="1">yet.</text><text start="14.32" dur="1">And they are as follows.</text><text start="15.32" dur="1.6">The first is technology.</text><text start="16.92" dur="4.01">Lots of scientists are searching the skies
for messages from aliens in the form of radio</text><text start="20.93" dur="1">waves.</text><text start="21.93" dur="1.46">We&amp;#39;ve had radio waves for about a century.</text><text start="23.39" dur="5.21">Our species has been around for about 1.5 million
years so that&amp;#39;s about 0.005 % of how long</text><text start="28.6" dur="3.96">we’ve been on the planet or you know, this.</text><text start="32.56" dur="1">Just here.</text><text start="33.56" dur="4.58">Yeah, that’s you and.... your pathetic life.</text><text start="38.14" dur="3.349">Radio is the best we&amp;#39;ve got at the moment,
but do you really want to bet it&amp;#39;s the best</text><text start="41.489" dur="2.19">mode of communication we&amp;#39;ll always have forever?</text><text start="43.679" dur="6.281">What if, in say, a thousand years, just here,
we discover another mode of communication?</text><text start="49.96" dur="3.369">Imagine you&amp;#39;re an ape living in the forest
and one day you decide there must be other,</text><text start="53.329" dur="2.46">smarter apes out there so you start trying
to communicate with them.</text><text start="55.789" dur="1.251">What would you do?</text><text start="57.04" dur="1.37">Probably everything you know how to.</text><text start="58.41" dur="1">Shout a bit.</text><text start="59.41" dur="1">Throw shit.</text><text start="60.41" dur="1">Give up.</text><text start="61.41" dur="2.27">Much like my recent experiences with the Bulgarian
immigration office.</text><text start="63.68" dur="3.15">And all that time, you&amp;#39;re going to be missing
the fact that there are smarter hairless apes</text><text start="66.83" dur="4.14">out there, billions of them, flying right
over you in big metal birds, and transmitting</text><text start="70.97" dur="2.75">magic waves straight through your body without
you ever knowing.</text><text start="73.72" dur="4">Because, frankly, the idea is just too far
out for your little ape brain right now</text><text start="77.72" dur="4.39">So, we&amp;#39;re about here, with technology we&amp;#39;ve
had for this long, and we&amp;#39;re expecting all</text><text start="82.11" dur="1.57">aliens to be here too.</text><text start="83.68" dur="3.59">In reality, if they&amp;#39;ve probably been around
for longer than we have, they might be here,</text><text start="87.27" dur="2.79">using technology we can’t even imagine right
now.</text><text start="90.06" dur="4.01">The second problem is smarts and it&amp;#39;s even
harder to get around.</text><text start="94.07" dur="2.46">Every time we send out a Hi?</text><text start="96.53" dur="3.97">Into the cosmos it assumes aliens would even
give a shit about talking to us in the first</text><text start="100.5" dur="1">place.</text><text start="101.5" dur="1.06">We&amp;#39;d like to think they would.</text><text start="102.56" dur="6.01">I mean look at all of our fascinating culture.</text><text start="108.57" dur="4.21">Look at all of our noble accomplishments.</text><text start="112.78" dur="19.569">Look at the wonderful feats we&amp;#39;re capable
of. Look at all of the fantastic things we have to boast about.</text><text start="132.349" dur="3.951">The thing is, and I&amp;#39;ve covered this one before
in a video about AI, how much of shit do we</text><text start="136.3" dur="3.249">give about species on our own planet less
intelligent than us?</text><text start="139.549" dur="3.731">We&amp;#39;re certainly not trying to teach them how
to do calculus or play the accordion.</text><text start="143.28" dur="1">Why?</text><text start="144.28" dur="5.98">Because you&amp;#39;re lovely, Charles Bonobo ape,
congratulations on evolving this far, Mr.</text><text start="150.26" dur="2.839">Johnny Crow face, but you’re both going to suck
as a wingman.</text><text start="153.099" dur="2.441">You don’t even have an alphabet or pornography
yet.</text><text start="155.54" dur="2.809">No offense but evolve a bit then we’ll chat
yeah?</text><text start="158.349" dur="4.181">Likewise, if you&amp;#39;re some smart arse alien
civilisation who has discovered antigravity</text><text start="162.53" dur="4.89">and hangover free alcohol, how much would you really
have to say to primitive warring monkeys who</text><text start="167.42" dur="2.159">still haven&amp;#39;t even cracked immortality?</text><text start="169.579" dur="1.151">Sup.</text><text start="170.73" dur="5.349">How&amp;#39;s war and social media and still using
toilet paper working out for you?</text><text start="176.079" dur="2.86">Yeah, let&amp;#39;s chat again when you’re not still
total idiots, eh?</text><text start="178.939" dur="1">Ciao.</text><text start="179.939" dur="3.47">And that&amp;#39;s also ignoring the problem that
their brains might not even be wired remotely</text><text start="183.409" dur="1.261">like ours.</text><text start="184.67" dur="1.039">If they have brains.</text><text start="185.709" dur="4.161">Their language – if they have a language
– might be so difficult to speak – if</text><text start="189.87" dur="5.629">it&amp;#39;s spoken – that we can&amp;#39;t even reply – if
they write to us in the first place.</text><text start="195.499" dur="2.74">Just look at the diversity of life on Earth.</text><text start="198.239" dur="1.461">Anyone speak dolphin?</text><text start="199.7" dur="1">No?</text><text start="200.7" dur="3.56">I’ve got a GCSE in Spanish if that helps.</text><text start="204.26" dur="3.479">That&amp;#39;s the second problem, intelligence, and
it relies on us finding other species who</text><text start="207.739" dur="3.211">are at almost exactly the same point in development
as us.</text><text start="210.95" dur="3.5">That is, slightly above flinging our own faeces,
but still trying to blow each other up.</text><text start="214.45" dur="3.84">The final problem, my personal favourite,
is extinction and this is kind of the one</text><text start="218.29" dur="1">to worry about.</text><text start="219.29" dur="3.72">One answer to: if the universe is so big,
where be aliens though?</text><text start="223.01" dur="1.059">Is, well...</text><text start="224.069" dur="4.181">70 years ago or so we discovered nuclear weapons.</text><text start="228.25" dur="3.65">There are now around 15,000 warheads on the
planet, capable of obliterating life a few</text><text start="231.9" dur="1">times over.</text><text start="232.9" dur="2.379">This has happened in 7 decades.</text><text start="235.279" dur="4.05">In the entire history of technology we went
from a bit mouthy but most harmless to could</text><text start="239.329" dur="4.58">wipe themselves and everything else out in
just under an hour . And that&amp;#39;s just one technology</text><text start="243.909" dur="1">we&amp;#39;ve discovered.</text><text start="244.909" dur="1.741">Do you wanna bet we&amp;#39;re not going to find more?</text><text start="246.65" dur="1.339">Doesn&amp;#39;t even have to be weaponry.</text><text start="247.989" dur="3.681">There might be something built into physics
for example where species accidentally create</text><text start="251.67" dur="5.51">black holes or some other deadly event, or
incurable superbugs, or that giant Yellowstone</text><text start="257.18" dur="5.04">tit thing going off, not to forget all the
methane under the ocean, solar flares that</text><text start="262.22" dur="3.29">could roast our entire civilisations with
only a few minutes warning, or just another</text><text start="265.51" dur="4.85">asteroid like the one that wiped out the dinosaurs
or just anything along those lines.</text><text start="270.36" dur="4.21">If other species are out there, they’re
probably facing, or have faced, the same threats.</text><text start="274.57" dur="4.879">It might be that only 1% of civilisations
get through that window and evolve into peace-loving-tech-monkeys</text><text start="279.449" dur="13.131">at the other end.</text><text start="292.58" dur="5.76">Or it might be 0% explaining why no one&amp;#39;s
out there returning our calls.</text><text start="298.34" dur="4.02">So, that&amp;#39;s the happy haps.</text><text start="302.36" dur="1.149">Where be aliens?</text><text start="303.509" dur="4.291">Probably dead/too evolved/too
far away/busy playing civ 6.</text><text start="307.8" dur="1.5">Steam handle exurb1a by the way.</text><text start="309.3" dur="3.69">Because to even get a reply back we might
need to be at exactly the right point in technological</text><text start="312.99" dur="3.251">development, sending messages that actually
appear smart enough, to civilisations who</text><text start="316.241" dur="2.409">haven&amp;#39;t already fucking wiped themselves out.</text><text start="318.65" dur="4.9">If it makes you feel any better, keep in mind
we’re the smartest, most intellectual, sophisticated,</text><text start="323.55" dur="7.44">and sentient, creatures we’ve found in the
entire universe so far.</text><text start="330.99" dur="1.81">Then again you also began life as an orgasm</text><text start="332.8" dur="1">Stay humble</text><text start="333.8" dur="19.07">Bye.</text></transcript>
