<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.2" dur="3.22">We&amp;#39;re all down with asking what if we&amp;#39;re living in a video game without realizing,</text><text start="3.48" dur="4.66">and &amp;quot;I think therefore I am&amp;quot; and shit, but there&amp;#39;s actually quite a good argument for it.</text><text start="8.74" dur="5.72">The Swedish Philosopher Nick Bostrom has this thing called &amp;quot;the Simulation Argument&amp;quot;, and it&amp;#39;s actually sort of compelling.</text><text start="14.54" dur="4.7">All right, so let&amp;#39;s imagine life is a pretty common phenomenon in the universe because,</text><text start="19.3" dur="5.8">c&amp;#39;mon, it probably is; stuff has been around for at least 13 billion years. Even if life is relatively rare,</text><text start="25.16" dur="3.2">that&amp;#39;s a lot of time to do something rare a few times over at least.</text><text start="28.54" dur="3.68">Then, let&amp;#39;s imagine some of those civilizations are technological,</text><text start="32.34" dur="3.48">And sometimes they get to this thing called being post-human (or post wookie)</text><text start="35.88" dur="3.36">where they&amp;#39;ve got these insanely fast computers that can run consciousness on them.</text><text start="39.32" dur="5.7">So, they might run these things called &amp;quot;ancestor simulations&amp;quot; where they model their ancestors on a computer and run it,</text><text start="45.1" dur="3.54">and if you were in one of these programs, the simulation will be so convincing,</text><text start="48.64" dur="2.84">you just wouldn&amp;#39;t know the difference between the real world and the simulation.</text><text start="51.56" dur="3.46">So, one of these statements has to be true, according to Nick Bostrom:</text><text start="55.1" dur="3.88">1) Hardly any civilizations actually get to a post-human level.</text><text start="59.08" dur="3.98">Maybe, they blow themselves up first or discover tvtropes.com or something.</text><text start="63.14" dur="6.92">2) They DO get to a post human level, but they don&amp;#39;t give a crap about running ancestor simulations. Fair enough.</text><text start="70.36" dur="3.06">Or 3) They DO run ancestor simulations,</text><text start="73.5" dur="2.5">and that means we&amp;#39;re probably living in one.</text><text start="76.08" dur="5.16">Here&amp;#39;s why:  if you had that much computing power, you could run millions of these simulations,</text><text start="81.32" dur="2.2">maybe varying each one to see what would happen.</text><text start="83.62" dur="2.94">So, there might only be a few million civilizations in the Galaxy,</text><text start="86.64" dur="6.62">But if 1% of them are doing the ancestor simulation thing, that means there could be billions of ancestor simulations running right now,</text><text start="93.32" dur="3.34">and that means potentially trillions of people living inside of them.</text><text start="96.86" dur="5.12">So, it&amp;#39;s far more likely you&amp;#39;re living in an ancestor simulation than the actual universe.</text><text start="102.08" dur="3.52">Yeah, but why would you run a simulation of people in 2013?</text><text start="105.72" dur="4.64">Well, if you ran it any later we might have the technology to start building our own ancestor simulations.</text><text start="110.46" dur="4.76">Creating a sort of stacking effect where you&amp;#39;ve got simulations inside the simulations like a fucking Russian doll FROM HELL.</text><text start="115.22" dur="1.62">...and that would just be plain confusing.</text><text start="116.9" dur="3.6">What&amp;#39;s kind of interesting is that even for these post-human gods running our simulation,</text><text start="120.56" dur="3.92">they must have thought about this, too and concluded that they could be living in a simulation.</text><text start="124.54" dur="6.88">And maybe whoever&amp;#39;s running theirs have thought about it up-and-up. Never really reaching a point where you could be absolutely sure this was real reality.</text><text start="131.52" dur="0.62">I mean</text><text start="132.15" dur="3.779">That&amp;#39;s just never going away is it? However many levels up in the simulation chain you are,</text><text start="136" dur="3.64">you&amp;#39;re always going to get some douchebag philosopher ruining it for everyone.</text><text start="139.72" dur="4.4">What little we do know about whoever is running the simulation is a bit sinister, really.</text><text start="144.22" dur="5.36">They certainly don&amp;#39;t seem to mind not stopping death in large numbers or suffering or political tyranny or terrible music,</text><text start="149.66" dur="2.92">so they&amp;#39;re certainly not all benevolent and flower-power.</text><text start="152.66" dur="5.96">And that&amp;#39;s concerning on a number of levels, unless it&amp;#39;s just you in the simulation and everyone&amp;#39;s an extra.</text><text start="161.4" dur="2.06">But that&amp;#39;s just plain horrible to think about.</text><text start="163.54" dur="1.78">So... what now?</text><text start="165.42" dur="5.34">Nick Bostrom says that maybe we should take note of this and act accordingly. Like, if we [?] as a species,</text><text start="170.76" dur="5.43">maybe whoever&amp;#39;s running it will just get bored and turn it off. There&amp;#39;s no reason to suspect their super moral or not super moral</text><text start="176.19" dur="4.93">I mean, we&amp;#39;re pretty smart and still basically just territorial apes with nuclear warheads, so...</text><text start="181.2" dur="5.6">intelligence doesn&amp;#39;t seem to correlate with the lack of interest in violence. So maybe they&amp;#39;re just doing it for fun.</text><text start="186.9" dur="4.16">Or if computers are powerful enough, maybe we could all just be sat on some kids PC</text><text start="191.06" dur="4.22">just one tab over from some feature incarnation of YouPorn and BBC news</text><text start="195.38" dur="3.12">Is there any way, then, that we would know we&amp;#39;re in a simulation?</text><text start="198.6" dur="1.98">– actual evidence...</text><text start="200.64" dur="6.92">Maybe. If reality on a subatomic level turns out to be suspiciously computational looking, that might be a clue.</text><text start="207.64" dur="4.32">Maybe we should modify our search for a Theory of Everything in Physics accordingly,</text><text start="212.04" dur="5.56">or there might be glitches, but that seems kind of unlikely given that whoever&amp;#39;s doing this must be pretty tech savvy by now.</text><text start="217.66" dur="3.86">Besides, they could just [?] your memory if there&amp;#39;s screw-ups anyway, so there&amp;#39;s no reason you know about it.</text><text start="221.6" dur="3.48">In case You&amp;#39;re watching this, Computer Overlords...</text><text start="225.16" dur="4.98">I&amp;#39;m sorry about all the war and Robert Mugabe and the Twilight Saga and everything...</text><text start="230.16" dur="1.46">but we&amp;#39;ve been to the moon now!</text><text start="231.68" dur="3.24">And you can order pizza over the internet, so we&amp;#39;re not doing too badly.</text><text start="235" dur="5">All in all, the moral of the story, then, is live a reasonably interesting life –</text><text start="240.1" dur="3.98">ride a unicycle, learn crochet, write a book or something</text><text start="244.14" dur="1.18">– so you don&amp;#39;t all get us turned off!</text></transcript>
