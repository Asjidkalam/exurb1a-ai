home yesterday but then you remembered</text><text start="31.28" dur="2.29">you had to get some bread as well so you went to the bread aisle.</text><text start="33.57" dur="3.25">However the alcohol aisle was on the way to the bread aisle so you went there first because</text><text start="36.82" dur="3.37">recently you&amp;#39;ve been doing quite a lot of drinking alone (if by recently you mean the</text><text start="40.19" dur="4.61">last 12 years) and they had this new 45% bourbon which was pretty cool, which you bought and</text><text start="44.8" dur="1.24">then forgot to buy milk.</text><text start="46.04" dur="3.12">So really the milk is gone because of whisky.</text><text start="49.16" dur="3.499">But really you only went to buy whisky because it&amp;#39;s kind of been a cloudy day and you wanted</text><text start="52.659" dur="1.001">to cheer yourself up a bit.</text><text start="53.66" dur="3.38">And it&amp;#39;s only really been a cloudy day because of temperature differential over the balkan</text><text start="57.04" dur="3.22">peninsula, brought on by east moving winds and pressure fluctuations.</text><text start="60.26" dur="3.37">So really the milk is gone because of the weather.</text><text start="63.63" dur="3.37">But the weather is only really there because of the atmosphere which formed about 4 billion</text><text start="67" dur="2.67">years ago, as a result of gas escaping from the Earth&amp;#39;s interior.</text><text start="69.67" dur="3.059">So the milk is gone because of the Earth.</text><text start="72.729" dur="3.661">But the Earth is only really there because a gas cloud condensed into the sun and the solar</text><text start="76.39" dur="1.659">system a few billion ago.</text><text start="78.049" dur="3.811">And all of that came from the big bang, billions of years before that. So really the milk is</text><text start="81.86" dur="6.01">gone because space and time materialized out of apparently nothing... 14 billion years ago.</text><text start="87.87" dur="4.21">And if that&amp;#39;s true did the universe know 14 billion years ago that if she exploded, formed</text><text start="92.08" dur="3.88">into galaxies and stars and they gave rise to planets and the planets developed ecosystems,</text><text start="95.96" dur="4.15">single celled life, complex organisms, humans,
human society, domestication of cows,</text><text start="100.11" dur="4.08">the invention of coffee, milk in coffee, fridges
and finally you, that you that you would eventually</text><text start="104.19" dur="4.15">run out of milk, fourteen billion years later?</text><text start="108.34" dur="1">Well... maybe.</text><text start="109.34" dur="4.41">If you&amp;#39;re playing pool or snooker or whatever
and you hit the ball at a certain angle at</text><text start="113.75" dur="3.45">a certain speed, if you have a good enough
computer you could say exactly where the balls</text><text start="117.2" dur="1.44">are going to go, right?</text><text start="118.64" dur="1.73">It&amp;#39;s all predetermined.</text><text start="120.37" dur="3.76">If you took exactly the same shot a thousand
times the balls would do the same thing a</text><text start="124.13" dur="1.04">thousand times.</text><text start="125.17" dur="3.661">Well, if the big bang happened a thousand
times over just the way it did 14 billion</text><text start="128.831" dur="4.238">years would you run out of milk a thousand
times 14 billion years later?</text><text start="133.069" dur="2.961">And doesn&amp;#39;t that mean you entire life is already
determined, like the date of your birth and</text><text start="136.03" dur="3.05">death was already predicted the moment the
universe came into being and everything has</text><text start="139.08" dur="3.93">to happen in a certain order, just that way,
just like a pool game?</text><text start="143.01" dur="1.65">No, definitely not.</text><text start="144.66" dur="1.53">We&amp;#39;ve got free will, right?</text><text start="146.19" dur="4.1">I mean, just because the universe is made
of atoms bumping into each other that have</text><text start="150.29" dur="3.559">to act in a certain way based on what happened
before and just because your brain is made</text><text start="153.849" dur="3.11">of atoms that have to do the same thing and
it&amp;#39;s all part of the same system, you can</text><text start="156.959" dur="1.971">still just decide to do stuff, right?</text><text start="158.93" dur="1.07"> </text><text start="160" dur="1.069"> </text><text start="161.069" dur="4.161">Because otherwise we&amp;#39;re just balls in a cosmic
game of pool with no free will at all...meaning</text><text start="165.23" dur="3.399">we&amp;#39;re just robots caught in a deterministic
system with just an illusion of choice but</text><text start="168.629" dur="3.601">really having no control whatsoever over our
own lives deluding ourselves into thinking</text><text start="172.23" dur="2.47">we&amp;#39;re somehow different to all the other atoms
in the universe and that would mean you&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="174.7" dur="2.97">never made a real choice and you never will
and whatever you decide to do next in life</text><text start="177.67" dur="3.159">isn&amp;#39;t a decision at all but was always going
to happen and there&amp;#39;s no point to ever doing</text><text start="180.829" dur="3.41">anything ever again because everything was
predecided at the beginning of time and life</text><text start="184.239" dur="3.021">is completely meaningless and empty and â€“ fuck it 
black coffee is fine.</text></transcript>
