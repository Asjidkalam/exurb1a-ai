are ready to beam up,</text><text start="3.3" dur="3.42">but one of them is refusing to step into the transporter.</text><text start="6.96" dur="2.72">Oh? I&amp;#39;ll see to it that he beams up.</text><text start="10.26" dur="1.2">We&amp;#39;re losing their pattern!</text><text start="11.46" dur="1.92">Oh no, they&amp;#39;re forming.</text><text start="19.66" dur="2.56">We&amp;#39;re always like: What&amp;#39;s Bones&amp;#39;s 
problem?</text><text start="22.22" dur="1.74">Just get in the transporter, Bones.</text><text start="24.5" dur="1.592">Why are you being such a pussy, Bones?</text><text start="26.092" dur="2.848">Do you think there&amp;#39;s something really bad in the transporter, Bones?</text><text start="28.94" dur="1.5">Did it touch your bones?</text><text start="30.44" dur="3.04">Yeah, well, Bones is actually the bravest character in sci-fi history</text><text start="33.48" dur="1.79">because it&amp;#39;s
the only person who&amp;#39;s worked out this is</text><text start="35.27" dur="3.339">A FUCKING DEATH MACHINE and still
willingly steps into it.</text><text start="38.609" dur="4.611">So, you get in at one end, get disassembled, transmitted
across space as a signal,</text><text start="43.22" dur="4.979">reassembled at the other end, which is fine if you&amp;#39;re, you know, a Word document or a phone call,</text><text start="48.199" dur="2.382">or expendable or something, but not
human, yeah?</text><text start="50.581" dur="3.351">Like, if we took away the bit where you reassembled, this would just be</text><text start="53.94" dur="2.28">a scene of several people calmly walking to their deaths.</text><text start="56.56" dur="5.8">Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, bye, bye, bye bye, see - yeah, see
you in fucking Valhalla that is!</text><text start="62.36" dur="3.98">In fact, sci-fi becomes one long tragic story of
people committing genocide</text><text start="66.34" dur="2.26">in the most British and orderly way possible:</text><text start="68.6" dur="2.22">stepping up to their deaths like they&amp;#39;re
cuing for flu shots.</text><text start="70.82" dur="4.18">All sci-fi has two modes of teleporting, if you like: one is
called a wormhole</text><text start="75" dur="1.88">and one is called fucking dying.</text><text start="76.88" dur="3.72">A wormhole is a bridge in space where you tie
two points together and step through.</text><text start="80.6" dur="2.4">It&amp;#39;s a shortcut and no one dies.</text><text start="83" dur="1.53">The
other is where you break someone down</text><text start="84.53" dur="2.939">molecule by molecule and vaporize them,
so they&amp;#39;re dead.</text><text start="87.469" dur="2.97">But you make a copy at the end so
apparently it&amp;#39;s not killing.</text><text start="90.44" dur="3.46">And obviously the copy doesn&amp;#39;t feel like a
copy so there&amp;#39;s no one left to protest.</text><text start="93.9" dur="4.18">And all the while this guy is getting
called a pussy for not willingly stepping into the suicide machine.</text><text start="98.08" dur="1.719">Yeah? Well, what about that one?</text><text start="99.799" dur="4.201">That&amp;#39;s a wormhole, right? No, no, just
death.</text><text start="104" dur="2">You still get broken down and
reconstructed.</text><text start="106" dur="3.28">Oh, well, how about- No, no, just death.</text><text start="109.38" dur="2.48">Or - no. Also death.</text><text start="112.76" dur="3.779">Well, then there&amp;#39;s... Oh no, just
methodical genocide.</text><text start="116.539" dur="2.921">Yeah, that&amp;#39;s how you travel in the future:
You want to see space?</text><text start="119.46" dur="2.689">Well it&amp;#39;s the murder express or nothing!</text></transcript>
