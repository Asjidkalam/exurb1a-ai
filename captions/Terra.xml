<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.26" dur="5.12">it was a Sunday a normal one and without
warning 15 huge saucers appeared from the clouds</text><text start="5.38" dur="2.72">and hovered above 15 capital
cities</text><text start="8.109" dur="3.091">no one went to work and everyone watched their television and waited to see what</text><text start="11.2" dur="1.2">would happen next</text><text start="12.4" dur="3.99">nothing happened next the saucers were
silent sitting on the air doing nothing</text><text start="16.39" dur="2.01">at all not even wobbling</text><text start="18.4" dur="3.87">not really we tried to say hello in
every language we knew in Swahili in</text><text start="22.27" dur="4.56">Spanish or Morse code and binary and
still the saucers were quiet on the</text><text start="26.83" dur="3.3">second day we flew drones up close and
found they were made of a metal we had</text><text start="30.13" dur="4.019">never seen before and hovered by a method so clever it may as well have been magic</text><text start="34.149" dur="3.12">by the third day a few of us were
getting cocky and got close enough to</text><text start="37.269" dur="2.91">take selfies and we shouted up through
megaphones sorry,</text><text start="40.179" dur="3.75">what are you doing here? and the saucers stayed silent sitting on the air</text><text start="43.929" dur="4.11">doing nothing at all not even wobbling
and finally without warning around dinner time</text><text start="48.039" dur="3.54">a great booming voice came over
the world and the saucers said</text><text start="51.579" dur="4.381">Terrr-rrraa. sorry, we said, come again?</text><text start="55.96" dur="7.529">Terrr-rrraa ... Terra? we said and the saucers were
silent. terra thought the linguists: Latin</text><text start="63.489" dur="0.78">for Earth</text><text start="64.269" dur="4.2">maybe it&amp;#39;s a greeting of some kind.
terror thought the religious: Roman goddess</text><text start="68.469" dur="4.44">maybe she&amp;#39;s back and she&amp;#39;s angry.
terror thought the militaries add an -ism to the</text><text start="72.909" dur="1.681">end and we&amp;#39;ve got a big problem</text><text start="74.59" dur="3.569">by the fourth day saucerism was a
world religion and some of us wore</text><text start="78.159" dur="3.6">little spaceships around our necks and
began building churches Britain hold a</text><text start="81.759" dur="3.36">referendum to see if the saucers should
leave or stay and the Prime Minister</text><text start="85.119" dur="4.14">resigned. by the fifth day we went back
to work and economies ticked over, the</text><text start="89.259" dur="3.54">world went on as normal except for the
15 huge saucers which were perfectly</text><text start="92.799" dur="1.621">silent, sitting on the air,</text><text start="94.42" dur="3.96">doing nothing at all, not even wobbling,
not really. and on the sixth day the</text><text start="98.38" dur="2.94">government&amp;#39;s and monarchies had enough
and prime ministers and presidents and</text><text start="101.32" dur="3.39">queens and despots came onto the lawns of
their palaces and offices and looked up</text><text start="104.71" dur="2.549">at the sources and said: what do you want?</text><text start="107.259" dur="4.231">why are you here? and the saucers said
nothing for a moment and then came the</text><text start="111.49" dur="0.75">reply:</text><text start="112.24" dur="1.3">Terrr - rrraa,</text><text start="113.54" dur="6.36">they said, terrr - rrraa. a global state of
emergency was declared. they&amp;#39;re obviously</text><text start="119.9" dur="3.66">hostile, America said, we should build a
wall to keep the saucers out until we</text><text start="123.56" dur="1.59">figure out what this is all about.</text><text start="125.15" dur="3.359">we disagree, replied Russia, we should annex them and then claim they were our</text><text start="128.509" dur="1.231">saucers all along.</text><text start="129.74" dur="3.33">this is outrageous, Britain said, we frown
on violence of any kind.</text><text start="133.07" dur="3.42">right, America said, but what if there is a
slim to impossible chance they might</text><text start="136.49" dur="1.56">have weapons of mass destruction?</text><text start="138.05" dur="3.66">we&amp;#39;ve changed our minds let&amp;#39;s invade
immediately! now just calm down,</text><text start="141.71" dur="3.18">norway said, there&amp;#39;s no reason to be
violent maybe they&amp;#39;re telepathic or</text><text start="144.89" dur="3.21">something we don&amp;#39;t even know what their
intentions are. Norway is right,</text><text start="148.1" dur="4.14">Russia said, we should use nuclear weapons!
what? that&amp;#39;s literally the opposite of</text><text start="152.24" dur="3.78">what we just suggested! we agree with
Norway, Britain said. and us!</text><text start="156.02" dur="3.18">germany said. what the fuck is wrong with
you? norway said, there&amp;#39;s no reason to be</text><text start="159.2" dur="2.91">violent yet we don&amp;#39;t even know what
they&amp;#39;re going to... well, we disagree,</text><text start="162.11" dur="3.09">russia said, what are you going to do to
stop us? yeah, said France,</text><text start="165.2" dur="2.97">what are you going to do about it? now
look, sweden said, this is all getting a</text><text start="168.17" dur="0.66">bit tense</text><text start="168.83" dur="3.75">we don&amp;#39;t need to do anything rash! so you
want a war as well, huh? Britain said.</text><text start="172.58" dur="3.81">n-no, Sweden replied, we&amp;#39;ll just be
quietly sitting over here until all this is</text><text start="176.39" dur="0.51">over.</text><text start="176.9" dur="4.2">I say we get rid of Norway, France
whispered, then we fire on the saucers!</text><text start="181.1" dur="4.29">what&amp;#39;s that? norway said. we were just
asking if anyone has seen Emily recently</text><text start="185.39" dur="3.569">don&amp;#39;t bob haircuts look good on French
women? right...</text><text start="188.959" dur="4.651">norway said, so it&amp;#39;s going to be like that,
is it? the war lasted just over five</text><text start="193.61" dur="2.28">minutes and ended in complete global
destruction</text><text start="195.89" dur="3.15">those that survived ceased by coming
radiation poisoning and a nuclear winter</text><text start="199.04" dur="3.57">descended on the world blocking out the
Sun. cities were former shadows of</text><text start="202.61" dur="0.84">themselves</text><text start="203.45" dur="3.599">nothing but rubble remained. and through
the rubble came the call of the wind and</text><text start="207.049" dur="4.41">cockroaches listened to the wind and
survived and busied about below and all the</text><text start="211.459" dur="2.701">while the saucers waited above sitting
on the air</text><text start="214.16" dur="4.47">doing nothing at all not even wobbling
not really and finally the great voice</text><text start="218.63" dur="0.93">came again</text><text start="219.56" dur="1.42">terrr - rrraa,</text><text start="220.98" dur="8.009">it said, Terrr - rrraa, terr..ribly sorry to bother
you, our translation software is broken</text><text start="228.989" dur="3.131">could you point the way to Andromeda?</text><text start="232.12" dur="2.67">hello.........?</text><text start="234.79" dur="3">helllloooo.......?</text><text start="241.58" dur="3.45">they&amp;#39;re awfully quiet, aren&amp;#39;t they? Oh, they&amp;#39;re
probably just shy..</text><text start="245.69" dur="4.92">hey, what was with all those explosions?
dunno maybe they were having a party..</text><text start="251.39" dur="7.379">yeah maybe maybe it was a party..
ohhh, we &amp;#39;ve fucking done it again</text></transcript>
