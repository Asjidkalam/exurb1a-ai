for funsies.</text><text start="23.279" dur="1.541">This is an acoustic guitar.</text><text start="24.82" dur="3.42">You might recognise it from that dick on
campus who can only play three chords</text><text start="28.24" dur="2.109">and keeps trying to get your girlfriend into bed.</text><text start="30.349" dur="5.36">This note only lasts one beat, this is Sally
two beats, this is three beats McGee and Jodie fourster.</text><text start="35.82" dur="3.8">There&amp;#39;s also half a beat, quarter of a beat, an eighth of a beat, but let&amp;#39;s take it slow.</text><text start="39.62" dur="2.1">Put notes together and you get a chord.</text><text start="41.72" dur="3.78">Usually chords are happy called major or minor
which are the ones that make you want to kill yourself.</text><text start="45.72" dur="5.74">But don&amp;#39;t, because there&amp;#39;s also harmonies *sings* Minge! *stops singing*
which hold up the song, and melodies which</text><text start="51.469" dur="2.041">are the catchy bits that everyone everyone
remembers,</text><text start="53.51" dur="1.16">Forte means loud,</text><text start="54.67" dur="1.15">Piano means quiet,</text><text start="55.82" dur="1.36">Crescendo means get louder,</text><text start="57.2" dur="3.34">And Rocco Siffreddi means you&amp;#39;re Italian and you probably work in porn.</text><text start="61.12" dur="1.64">So we have a bassline and some rhythm.</text><text start="62.76" dur="1.76">Let&amp;#39;s add some cornets.</text><text start="73.54" dur="5">So, with the likelihood of sex to occur, versus
difficulty to learn an instrument, the cornet</text><text start="78.54" dur="2.46">is somewhere up top,  accompanied close behind by the</text><text start="81.2" dur="3.18">bagpipes, tuba, ocarina and nose flute,</text><text start="84.38" dur="3.571">On the other hand we have string instruments, electric guitar, and</text><text start="87.951" dur="3.399">Careless whisper played on the saxophone while
wearing nothing but a mankini.</text><text start="91.35" dur="3.07">Moving on, orchestras are essentially a big
musical gangbang.</text><text start="94.42" dur="2.26">The cornet belongs to the brass family.</text><text start="96.68" dur="4.1">There&amp;#39;s also the woodwind family who are a bit like the
awkward hufflepuffs, percussion who&amp;#39;s basically</text><text start="100.78" dur="5.03">billy no mates, and the strings section, who are the
elite elves of musical middle Earth, oh look</text><text start="105.81" dur="2.62">at us, leading the orchestra, taking all of
the credit.</text><text start="109.5" dur="2.68">I hope you all catch something rare and incurable.</text><text start="112.82" dur="4.04">Oh I almost forgot, the western scale has
twelve notes but other cultures use more or</text><text start="116.86" dur="1.29">less sometimes,</text><text start="118.16" dur="2.18">Sharps and flats are the black notes on a
piano.</text><text start="120.34" dur="4.64">If you don’t know what you’re doing you
can just mash them a bit and pretend it’s like jazz (?).</text><text start="125.2" dur="6.2">This is called a break down.Make it a bit sad. Remind people through the power of music that we all die alone.</text><text start="147.74" dur="7.1">Add a very long pause for effect. It’s usually best to do this before some
kind of massive climax with drums and stuff.</text><text start="155.16" dur="2.54">The longer you leave it the more anticipation
you build.</text><text start="158.32" dur="1">Like this.</text><text start="160.7" dur="2.2">I bet you’re really getting bored now aren’t
you.</text><text start="163.53" dur="2.15">Frankly we can call it quits here, really.</text><text start="165.68" dur="3.54">You’ve probably had enough of me, and I

get creative with the instruments, you&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="203.45" dur="4.54">got your rhythm, you&amp;#39;ve got your chords, got
your melody, go nuts, throw in some twiddles.</text><text start="207.99" dur="2.71">Lots of people say they wish they&amp;#39;d learned
an instrument when they were young.</text><text start="210.7" dur="3.5">Did you know Mozart didn&amp;#39;t start playing music
until he was 25?</text><text start="214.2" dur="5.66">Now that&amp;#39;s a total lie, but if you&amp;#39;ve got
time to watch youtube videos, you&amp;#39;ve got time to start learning an instrument. If you want to.</text><text start="219.92" dur="3.36">There&amp;#39;s a little starter playlist down below
if you&amp;#39;re interested for anything you want to learn.</text><text start="223.62" dur="1.46">It&amp;#39;s never too late.</text><text start="225.09" dur="1.01">Unless you&amp;#39;re dead.</text><text start="226.1" dur="2.29">Then it might be too late.</text><text start="228.39" dur="5.55">Finally build to the climax to fortissimo, the
